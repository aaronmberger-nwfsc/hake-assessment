From 2006 to 2008, a change in the migratory behavior of the offshore stock resulted in a shift of the entire fishery from the typical grounds off the west coast of Vancouver Island to the more northerly region of Queen Charlotte Sound. Management concerns regarding the unknown exploitation of any resident stocks prompted a re-examination of Pacific hake stock structure in Canadian waters. Population genetic techniques determined a connectivity of Pacific hake found in Queen Charlotte Sound in the summer to (1) the offshore migratory population; (2) the inshore resident population and (3) the populations in adjacent deepwater inlets. We provide evidence that supports the delineation of the resident and migratory stocks; and evidence of two other genetically differentiated resident groups. These results were supported by differences in biological parameters and parasite infection levels. Of note is the first record of the occurrence of the parasite Kudoa paniformis in the resident population.},

  abstract = {Eleven acoustic surveys carried out between 1991 and 2002 provided estimates of the relative abundance of spawning hoki in Cook Strait, New Zealand. The precision and bias of each survey were estimated using a new Monte Carlo simulation method, which combined uncertainties associated with survey timing, sampling error, detectability, species composition, target strength, calibration coefficients, and missing strata. Because hoki have a long spawning season (more than 2 months) with turnover of fish in the survey area, survey timing was the most important source of uncertainty. Uncertainty was reduced by having a number of sub-surveys (snapshots) over a 4–6 week period, centred on the middle date of the spawning season. The other major source of uncertainty was the occurrence of 40–70% of hoki in mixed species: “hoki fuzz” marks. The acoustic analysis assumed all acoustic backscatter from hoki marks was hoki, so the presence of other species caused a positive bias in relative-abundance indices. The magnitude of this bias differed between years because the proportion of hoki in the “fuzz” marks was variable. There was additional uncertainty from the variability in the species composition of mixed marks that affected survey precision. The abundance indices were corrected for estimated bias, and the estimate of precision, expressed as the coefficient of variation or c.v., was applied to weight the results from each acoustic survey in the assessment model used to set commercial-catch limits.}

Because the structure is specified the sampling may be undertaken on regular grids and the precision of the stock's total abundance can be derived. Two geostatistical methods relevant for total assessments are reviewed, then applied to an acoustic survey performed along regularly spaced parallel transects. For such surveys a very simple and general procedure for calculating the precision is suggested: the geostatistical transitive theory can be used in one-dimension (1-D) on the transect cumulated data. The procedure is explained and compared to the more complicated computation that could be undertaken in the two-dimensional (2-D) longitude-latitude plane.}

Biological processes such as fishery selectivity, natural mortality, and somatic growth can vary over time, but it is challenging to estimate the magnitude of time-variation of demographic parameters in population dynamics models, particularly when using penalized-likelihood estimation approaches. Random-effect approaches can estimate the variance, but are computationally infeasible or not implemented for many models and software packages. We show that existing models and software based on penalized-likelihood can be used to calculate the Laplace approximation to the marginal likelihood of parameters representing variability over time, and specifically demonstrate this approach via application to Stock Synthesis. Using North Sea cod and Pacific hake models as case studies, we show that this method has little bias in estimating variances for simulated data. It also provides a similar estimate of variability in hake recruitment (log-SD = 1.43) to that obtained from Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods (log-SD = 1.68), and the method estimates a non-trivial magnitude (log-SD = 0.07) of variation in growth for North Sea cod. We conclude by discussing the generality of the proposed method and by recommending future research regarding its performance relative to MCMC, particularly when estimating multiple variances simultaneously.}
