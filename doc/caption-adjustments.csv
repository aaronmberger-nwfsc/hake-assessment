# For manual adjustments of captions. Some of the captions will not line up
# perfectly with the header and footer lines. nudging them a bit
# left (negative number) or right (postivie number) will line them up
# perfectly
#
# Note that all these tags have to be in the ORDER IN WHICH THEY APPEAR
# IN THE DOCUMENT! The values are determined by trial-and-error looking at
# the document after it's built
#
# Make sure you prepend the label with tab: for tables and fig: for figures
