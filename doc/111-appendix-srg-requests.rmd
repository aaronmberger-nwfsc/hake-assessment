# Scientific Review Group (SRG) requests {#sec:app-srg-requests}

This appendix summarizes results produced in response to Scientific Review
Group requests made during the meeting held from February 6--9, `r assess_yr`.

## Day 1

### Request 1 {-}

List the sample sizes for males, females and unsexed (for the weight-at-age),
for the U.S. and Canada. This will help to understand the effect of averaging
unsexed fish into empirical weight-at-age and provide some insight into the
differences spatially of weight-at-age.

**JTC Response**

The JTC provided two tables, one for each country containing the
weight-at-age sample sizes for each sex code(Male = M, Female = F,
Unsexed = U), by country (Tables~\@ref(tab:srg-weight-at-age-sample-size-can)
and \@ref(tab:srg-weight-at-age-sample-size-us)).

(ref:srg-plot-weight-at-age-by-sex-cap) Weight-at-age by sex for two
fishing years, 2018 and 2023.

(ref:srg-plot-weight-at-age-by-sex-alt) This plot shows the weight-at-age being
substantially higher for 2018 fish than 2023 fish. Also, the females are larger
than the males for both years, as they should be.

(ref:srg-plot-base-v-tv-maturity-ssb-cap) Spawning biomass for the pre-SRG
base model compared to the final base model which has sexed weight-at-age
included.

(ref:srg-plot-base-v-tv-maturity-ssb-alt) This plot shows that the spawning
biomass for the final base model ends at a much higher level than the model
submitted for review.

```{r srg-plot-base-v-tv-maturity-ssb-fig, out.height = "85%",  fig.cap = "(ref:srg-plot-base-v-tv-maturity-ssb-cap)"}

```

(ref:srg-plot-base-v-tv-maturity-rel-cap) Relative spawning biomass for the
pre-SRG base model compared to the final base model which has sexed
weight-at-age included.

(ref:srg-plot-base-v-tv-maturity-rel-alt) This plot shows that the relative
spawning biomass for the final base model ends at close to B zero.

```{r srg-plot-base-v-tv-maturity-rel-fig, out.height = "85%",  fig.cap = "(ref:srg-plot-base-v-tv-maturity-rel-cap)"}
plot_rel_biomass(list(old_base_model, base_model),
                 model_names = m_names,
                 ylim = c(0, 2.75))
```

### Request 2 {-}

On Figure G.11 add the data for proportion mature at age-2 (if possible)
and age-3 to the model prediction of maturity at age-2 (if possible) and
age-3 from the temperature-based model.

**JTC Response**

The JTC provided two figures showing the proportion mature by year and
temperature.

* Figure~\@ref() shows empirical results for age 2 and
  Figure~\@ref() shows
  empirical results for age 3. Data are included from non-ASHOP samples because
  that is what the curve is predicting. For each year (denoted on the smooth
  line) the points appear above or below the labeled point from the same year.
* We do not expect the points to overlap or lie on the line because the curve
  represents the marginal effect of temperature (e.g., predicted maturity from
  non-ASHOP samples collected from an average sample location on July 1).
* Changing the reference date from July 1 to a later date for age-3 fish would
  have the effect of shifting the curve up closer to the points because the
  non-ASHOP samples occur later in the year (25% before July1/75% after). The
  points are also affected by variable sampling effort year to year.
* In conclusion, we would never really expect the empirical estimates to
  perfectly match the model-based ones. Sampling varies across space and time,
  and the empirical estimates do not account for any of this variation.

(ref:srg-prop-age-2-mature-by-temp-cap) Proportion of age-2 fish mature by
year and sea temperature.

(ref:srg-prop-age-2-mature-by-temp-alt) This figure shows that the proportion
of age 2 fish mature is approximately 0.15 for 2020 and 2018 at a temperature
of 9 degrees Celsius.

```{r srg-prop-age-2-mature-by-temp-fig, results = "asis", out.height = "85%", fig.cap = "(ref:srg-prop-age-2-mature-by-temp-cap)"}
include_graphics(file.path(figures_dir,
                           "2024-srg-response-1-2-a.png"),
                 error = FALSE)
```

(ref:srg-prop-age-3-mature-by-temp-cap) Proportion of age-3 fish mature by
year and sea temperature.

(ref:srg-prop-age-3-mature-by-temp-alt) This figure shows that the proportion
of age 3 fish mature is approximately 0.6 for 2020 and 2018 at a temperature
of 9 degrees Celsius.

## Request 3 -- Add $SB_{2023}/SB_{0}$ to Table 25 {-}

```

## Request 4 -- Clean vs mixed species survey trawls {-}

In 2023 the acoustic-trawl survey had 13 regions out of 282 that were
classified as hake mix. These regions were associated with 4 separate
trawls. The hake percentages in those hake mix trawls ranged from 55%
to 76% hake (all mixed with rockfish).

22.9 kmt out of the 735 kmt of unkriged biomass (3.1%) came from hake
mixes in 2023.

## Request 5 -- "Tabular 2008--2026 maturity-at-age data"

The projections use the mean of the maturity-at-age for 2019--2023.
