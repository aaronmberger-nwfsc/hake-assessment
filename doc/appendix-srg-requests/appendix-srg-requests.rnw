\section{Day 2}

{\bf Request 1:}

The SRG requests that the JTC use a three year average of weight-at-age to produce projections of spawning biomass for constant catch levels of 0 and 380,000 t, and associated one-year probabilities with these catches as in Table i of the Executive Summary. The catch associated with the default harvest rate for 2021 would also be useful.  These results will show the influence of the 5-year averaging of weight-at-age in the projections, especially given that 2016 is a year with low weight-at-age. It may support investigating alternative methods for predicting weight-at-age in the future. If the JTC has done this kind of analysis in the past, then the JTC can use itâ€™s discretion regarding completion of this request.

{\bf JTC Response:}

The JTC followed the request of the SRG and calculated a three-year average weight-at-age to produce projections using the forecast parameters in Stock Synthesis. Since the forecast parameters are estimated in the base model run, the entire NUTS run had to be re-run for this new model prior to running the 2-year forecasting with the new weights-at-age. This run took approximately 4.5 hours for the NUTS portion, and another 3 hours for the forecasting and model loading steps. Table~\ref{tab:srg-day2-request1-decision-table} shows the relative biomass decision table for this case which is identical to the decision table (Table~\ref{tab:es-decisions-biomass}) found in the Executive summary and can be compared directly.

When compared to the base model decision table, Table~\ref{tab:srg-day2-request1-decision-table} shows an increase in median relative spawning biomass for all constant catch streams (rows a--g). The credible interval is also shifted upwards be several percent relative to the base model.

Table~\ref{tab:srg-day2-request1-risk-table} shows probabilities of several important biomass events compared across catch levels. When compared to the base model (Table~\ref{tab:es-risk-year-1}), the probability that:

- $B_{2022}$ is less than $B_{2021}$ is within 1\% of the base model.

- $B_{2022}$ is less than $B_{40\%}$ is lower for all constant catch levels, and within 4\% of the base model.

- $B_{2022}$ is less than $B_{10\%}$ is 0\% or 1\% for all constant catch levels, and within 1\% of the base model.

{\bf Request 2:}

Run the 3 yr projection for relative spawning biomass to the start of 2024. These results will enable the SRG to evaluate the width of the CI really for a three year projection, we have the data if we decide to include a 3-yr projection in the table, and the Canadian delegation has the numbers (even if this does not make it into the assessment or SRG report).
(With default weight etc.)

{\bf JTC Response:}

The JTC ran the 3-year projections required to make the table, and re-coded the decision table to display the results in a way similar to that shown in a mock-up table provided by the SRG. Due to there being one more forecast parameter, the entire NUTS run had to be re-run for this new model prior to running the 3-year forecasting. This run took approximately 4.5 hours for the NUTS portion, and another 4 hours for the forecasting and model loading steps.

Table~\ref{tab:srg-day2-request2-decision-table} shows the new table, which can be compared with the base model decision table (Table~\ref{tab:es-decisions-biomass}) found in the Executive summary.

Differences between the the new table and the current one in the Executive summary include:

- 2021 biomass is shown in a single row at the top ({\emph Start 2021}) in the new table. In the current one, it is the first row in every row chunk (a--j).

- values shown as proportions instead of as percentages. This allows the removal of all the percentage signs shown on on the relative biomass values which are distracting.

- removal of the 25\% and 75\% columns.

- addition of a new column, {\emph Biomass year}, which gives the timing that the biomass values in the table represent.

- re-naming of the header for the relative biomass values from {\emph Beginning of year relative spawning biomass} to {\emph Resulting relative spawning biomass}.

- the values shown in the {\emph Resulting relative spawning biomass} columns now represent the biomass at the beginning of the year which result due to the catch taken in the previous year, which is found in the ({\emph Catch year}) column.

% Andy's stuff - 2021
\section{Further analyses}

During the JTC's briefing presentation to the Joint Management Committee on February
11, 2021, a comment was raised about the probabilities in the decision tables
(such as Tables~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1} and~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-2}) changing from assessment to assessment. The
probabilities do indeed change from, for example, \Sexpr{assess.yr - 1} to
\Sexpr{assess.yr} because the \Sexpr{assess.yr} assessment model depends on the catch
in \Sexpr{assess.yr - 1}, and has further updated data (such as
proportions-at-age for earlier cohorts). But this comment led us
to investigate the general question of how much confidence can we have in the
probabilities in the decision tables.

% Doing some numbers manually to get done. Next year can supply Tables also,
% plus automate a bit. Plus do a kind of retrospective analysis, maybe as an
% animation.

As an example, the 2019 assessment gave the probability of the spawning stock
biomass declining in the subsequent year, i.e.~P($B_{2020} < B_{2019}$),
for each value of several possible catches in 2019 (such as 0~t, 180,000~t,
350,000~t, 410,000~t etc.). Now, in \Sexpr{assess.yr}, we \emph{know} that the catch in 2019 was
411,574~t. Therefore, we can select the 410,000~t row (which is close enough to
411,574~t) in the table from the 2019
assessment to give that assessment's P$(B_{2020} < B_{2019}) = 61\%$, given the catch
that we now know occurred in 2019.

We can also calculate P($B_{2020} < B_{2019}$) using the current
assessment model, i.e.~calculate our most up-to-date estimate of the probability
that the stock declined from 2019 to 2020 using all available data. This
implicitly includes the 411,574~t catch from 2019. From the current assessment
model we get P$(B_{2020} < B_{2019}) = 98\%$. The 65\% and 98\% probabilities
are shown for 2019 in Figure~\ref{fig:appendix-srg-historical-1}.

We have done similar calculations for past assessments, currently going back to
2012. Specifically, for each assessment year $t$, we calculate
P$(B_{t+1} < B_{t} | \mbox{catch we now know to have occurred in year}~t)$ from
the year $t$ assessment, and also calculate
P$(B_{t+1} < B_{t})$ from the current base model (results in Figure~\ref{fig:appendix-srg-historical-1}).
The first probability requires interpolation between catch levels if
the exact catch in year $t$ was not given in the decision tables in year $t$'s assessment.

The probability of subsequent decline of 43\% from the 2012 assessment is
somewhat above the 0\% calculated using the current assessment model
(Figure~\ref{fig:appendix-srg-historical-1}). But this make sense, because the
2012 assessment model had no information that the 2010 recruitment was going to be very large,
whereas the current base model does have such information from many years of age
data. Hence, the current model confidently `expects' a large increase in spawning biomass
from 2012 to 2013 as the individuals in the 2010 cohort grow in size. The 2013
assessment model has some information on the 2010 cohort, and so gives a much
lower probability that the stock will decline from 2013 to 2014, which concurs
with the current base model (Figure~\ref{fig:appendix-srg-historical-1}).

For later years, the probabilities switch in tandem to being above or below
50\%, i.e. each assessment correctly predicts whether the stock will increase or
decrease the following year. Note that for all years except 2018, the assesment
year's probabilities are closer to 50\% than those from the current base
model. This is ....****ANDY TO CONTINUE, add projections explanation to fig caption***
