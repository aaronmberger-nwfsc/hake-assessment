\item Use, build, and expand upon the existing management strategy evaluation
  framework to evaluate major sources of
  uncertainty relating to data, model structure, and the harvest policy for this
  fishery (as needed) and compare potential methods to address them. In particular,
  utilize and adapt the management strategy evaluation framework to address new and ongoing
  stock assessment research and data needs through the Pacific Hake Management Strategy Evaluation
  Working Group, including relevant requests by the Scientific Review Group
  (see Section~\ref{sec:assessment-response-review}).
  For example, research investigating links between \fishname\ biomass,
  spatial distribution, growth, recruitment, and natural mortality, and how
  these biological processes vary with ocean conditions and ecosystem variables such as
  temperature, transport, and prey availability would be beneficial.
  Ongoing investigations have the potential to improve
  the scenarios considered in future work on the management strategy evaulation framework
  and the basic understanding of drivers of \fishname\
  population dynamics and availability to fisheries and surveys.

\item Complete the ongoing inter-laboratory otolith exchange and
  use the results to update estimates of ageing error used in the stock assessment.
  This would include updated information about ageing imprecision and the effects of
  large cohorts as understood given simulation analyses and
  blind-source age reads of samples with and without dominant year
  classes. The last inter-laboratory comparison was done in 2010 (``CARE''
  exchanges). Related, streamlining procedures that ease the exchange
  of biological materials (e.g., otoliths) across international borders
  would increase the efficiency at which research products can be produced.

\item Continue to collect and analyze life-history data, including weight,
  maturity, and fecundity for \fishname. Explore possible relationships among
  these life-history traits and correlations with
  time, empirical growth, and population density.
  Improve understanding of links between fecundity
  and size, age, weight, and batch spawning, as well as spatio-temporal
  variability in the timing of spawning, skip spawning, batch fecundity, and size
  and age at maturity. Additionally, a more spatially comprehensive maturity
  analysis that incorporates information from Canadian samples would be advantageous.

\item Explore the operational use of environmental DNA data for
  characterizing aspects of \fishname\ population dynamics, such as changes in
  species distribution or perhaps density, and the incorporation of these data
  into stock assessments. Recent research demonstrated that environmental DNA
  provides similar information as the acoustic survey at scales relevant to
  management, i.e., coast-wide and not just sample-to-sample comparisons
  \citep{SheltonRamonLacaEtAl2022}, but longer time series are needed before
  the data can be used to inform trends in abundance. Environmental DNA is now
  available for 2019 and 2021 (two years total). Continuing to extend the time series
  would allow for its incorporation in future stock assessments as an index of abundance.

\item Explore alternative approaches and related assumptions for parameterizing
  time-varying fishery selectivity in the assessment. Simulations that
  evaluate methods for including multiple variance structures, including interactions,
  tradeoffs, and related assumptions, across multiple processes (e.g., selectivity,
  recruitment, data weighting) in integrated stock assessment models would be
  particularly beneficial.

\item Revisit alternative methods for refining existing prior distributions
  for natural mortality, including the use of meta-analytic methods.
  Evaluate feasibility of estimating age-specific natural mortality for
  \fishname.

\item Explore mid-water community dynamics (or predator/prey relationships more generally)
  to better understand linkages to \fishname\ distribution, abundance, and growth.
  For example, weight-at-age data or other mechanistic linkages (e.g., from diet
  studies) can inform inter-annual variability and trends in growth, which
  can improve biomass forecasting capabilities for \fishname.

\item Explore the potential to use acoustic data collected from commercial
  fishing vessels to study \fishname\ distributions, schooling patterns, and other
  questions of interest. This could be similar to the
  ``acoustic vessels of opportunity'' program on fishing vessels
  targeting Pollock in Alaska \citep{StienessenHonkalehtoEtAl2019}.
