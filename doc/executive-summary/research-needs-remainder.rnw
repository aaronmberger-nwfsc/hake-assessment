%\item **Explore potential recruitment indices for juvenile or young (age-0 and/or
%  age-1) \fishname, including further investigations into survey options,
%  refinements, and analyses, as well as those that include environment
%  linkages. Investigate alternative ways to model and forecast recruitment, given
%  the uncertainty present.

\item Develop a set of candidate ecosystem indicators that are potentially
  associated with \fishname\ biology and ecology (e.g., recruitment, distribution,
  predator, and prey). Such information can broaden the context within which a single
  species stock assessment is interpreted, be used to support model development, and
  provide non-assessment indicators to management.

\item Conduct an inter-laboratory otolith exchange and
  use the results to update estimates of ageing error used in the stock assessment.
  This would include updated information about ageing imprecision and the effects of
  large cohorts as understood given simulation analyses and
  blind-source age reads of samples with
  differing underlying age distributions -- with and without dominant year
  classes. The last inter-laboratory comparison was done in 2010 (``CARE''
  exchanges). 

\item Continue to collect and analyze life-history data, including weight,
  maturity, and fecundity for \fishname. Explore possible relationships among
  these life-history traits and correlations with
  time, empirical growth, and population density.
  Improve understanding of links between fecundity
  and size, age, weight, and batch spawning, as well as spatio-temporal
  variability in the timing of spawning, skip spawning, batch fecundity, and size
  and age at maturity. Continue to explore the possibility of using
  additional data types such as length data within the stock assessment.
  Additionally, a more spatially comprehensive maturity analysis that
  incorporates information from Canadian samples would be advantageous.

\item Explore the operational use of eDNA data for characterizing aspects
  of \fishname\ population dynamics, such as changes in species distribution or
  perhaps density, and the incorporation of these data into stock assessments.

\item Maintain the flexibility to undertake additional acoustic surveys for
  \fishname\ in non-survey years when uncertainty in the results of the
  stock assessment presents a potential risk to or underutilization of the
  stock.

\item Explore alternative approaches and related assumptions for parameterizing
  time-varying fishery selectivity in the assessment. Simulations that
  evaluate methods for including multiple variance structures, including interactions,
  tradeoffs, and related assumptions, across multiple processes (e.g., selectivity,
  recruitment, data weighting) in integrated stock assessment models would be
  particularly beneficial.

\item Consider alternative methods for refining existing prior distributions
  for natural mortality ($M$), including the use of meta-analytic methods.
  Evaluate feasibility of estimating age-specific natural mortality for
  \fishname.

\item Explore the potential to use acoustic data collected from commercial
  fishing vessels to study hake distributions, schooling patterns, and other
  questions of interest. This could be similar to the
  ``acoustic vessels of opportunity'' program on fishing vessels
  targeting Pollock in Alaska \citep{StienessenHonkalehtoEtAl2019}.
