\chapter{Report of the 2021 \fishname\ fishery in the United States} % from the Advisory Panel}
\label{chap:us-fishery-report}

{\bf Prepared by the United States Advisory Panel and submitted for the Canada/US
  Joint Management Committee's and the Joint Technical Committee's consideration on
  January 25, 2022.}

The Mothership (MS), Catcher Processor (CP), and Shoreside (SS) sectors of the
U.S. fishery started on May 15, 2021.  The Tribal sector also began fishing in
the spring and operated throughout the 2021 season; however, effort was limited
to shoreside deliveries largely via use of a tender vessel. Consistent with normal
fishing patterns, the SS sector ramped-up across the spring and continued to harvest
and process its allocation throughout the summer, while the MS and CP sectors completed
their spring fishery in June and then paused hake fishing and processing until after the
completion of the Bering Sea pollock fishery. Relative to 2020, although still significant,
the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 had less of an effect on the industry.  Overall,
effort in the spring fishery was close to normal, especially in comparison to 2020 where COVID-19
outbreaks caused several processor closures and vessel port calls. Nonetheless, several vessels
had delays to their start in the at-sea sector due to COVID related issues and the ongoing
challenges associated with maintaining a full labor force were still significant
for many shoreside and at-sea processors throughout the 2021 season.

Fishery performance overall and throughout the 2021 season was very good in terms of catch
per unit effort (CPUE), fish size, wide spread availability on the grounds and in proximity
to the plants, and lower than normal incidental catch rates for the typical rockfish and
Chinook bycatch species. During the spring fishery, participants reported stronger schools
of fish than in recent years with fishing effort spread out along the coast from north to south
and in both deep and shallow bottom depths. Over the course of the 2021 season, the at-sea sectors
caught fish in the 500--700 gram range, as well as significant amounts of hake of about 400 grams
(on average) in May and October. There was consistent, but limited catch of hake larger than 600
grams, primarily in October, and trace amounts of smaller hake (less than 250 grams) were encountered
throughout the season. In general, fish size remained consistent throughout the year with the SS plants
noting little change in quality, size, and condition through the spring, summer and fall.
Throughout the entire year, fish quality was excellent with "healthy and fat" fish
being reported by at-sea and shoreside processors alike.

Fall fishery effort in the at-sea sectors began in mid-September, with CPs fishing the second
week of September and MS operations starting back up in late September/early October. Nine CPs
and three MS vessels participated in the fall fishery, with some vessels out of commission
for maintenance and shipyard work. Participating vessels reported excellent fishing and the best
fall fishing seen in recent years, especially in September and early October. A series of major storms
in mid/late October and typical hake migratory patterns reduced fishery productivity later in the fall.
SS operations began to taper off by mid-October. MS operations ended in mid- October. CP operations ended
in mid-November. While bycatch patterns were generally typical in the fall at-sea fishery,
the occurrence of large amounts of less typical species, such as jack mackerel, were challenging
because these species were often mixed with dense hake schools.

Hake were present consistently in the U.S. zone throughout the 2021 season. Fishing was good
on strong schools from the start of the fishery in May up to mid-October, when extraordinarily strong
storms hampered fishing effort. Bycatch monitoring and avoidance continued to be a primary
driver of U.S. fishing patterns. In addition to usual species of concern (widow rockfish,
canary rockfish, darkblotched rockfish, yellowtail rockfish, sablefish, and Chinook salmon), the
emergence of unusually large amounts of "new" species, such as shortbelly rockfish, jack mackerel,
and pacific (blue) mackerel proved challenging at times. No significant bycatch was observed
in the SS sector other than a few trips with some darkblotched rockfish and shortbelly rockfish.
The SS sector also reported that bycatch of yellowtail rockfish, which can be constraining for some vessels,
was very low overall in 2021, despite some early season encounters, particularly in the mothership
sector. Fishery participants believe that the lower than normal bycatch correlates, in part, to the
improved CPUE experienced in 2021. The use of cooperatives in each sector of the non-tribal fishery,
near real-time observer data, and third-party monitoring by Sea State Inc. continue to provide
fishery participants the necessary tools to closely monitor fishery progress, share information
broadly across the fishery, and minimize bycatch of non-target species.

Overall, the U.S. harvest in 2021 decreased slightly from 287,314 in 2020 to 269,300 in 2021 [these
values may be slightly different that in the stock assessment due to the timing of data extraction].
Utilization rates were generally consistent with those projected by industry at the March 2021
JMC meeting - SS sector before Tribal release was 99\% (89\% following Tribal release), CP sector
before Tribal release was 100\% (90\% following Tribal release), and MS sector was 48\% before
Tribal release (43\% following Tribal release). Utilization in the MS sector, as projected
pre-season, was low due to several processors being unable to participate in the spring
fishery and/or in the fall fishery due to shipyard schedules.
