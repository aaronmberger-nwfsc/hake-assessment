# For manual placement of tables and figures using float codes in LaTeX
#   make an entry into this file.
#
# Any entry here will override the placement codes generated by bookdown,
#   so if for example the bookdown-created TeX file contains:
# \begin{figure}[tbp]
#   for the figure with knitr label `es-example-fig` and the entry below is:
# figure,es-catches-fig,,!b
#   the resultig LaTex code will be:
# \begin{figure}[!b]
#
# Column descriptions:
# type: table or figure
# knitr_label: The knitr chunk label for the chunk which creates the
#   figure. If blank `file_name` will be used
# file_name: The file name for an image file inserted using rmarkdown
#   code. If blank, `knitr_label` will be used
# placement: One of the following LaTeX placement strings (or a
#   combination of them):
# - h: Place the float here, i.e., approximately at the same point it occurs
#      in the source text.
# - t: Position at the top of the page.
# - b: Position at the bottom of the page.
# - p: Put on a special page for floats only.
# - !: Override internal parameters LaTeX uses for determining “good” float
#      positions.
# - H: Place the float at precisely the location in the LaTeX code. This
#      requires the float package
