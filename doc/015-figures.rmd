(ref:main-overview-map-cap) Overview map of the area in the Northeast Pacific
Ocean occupied by `r sp`. Ports and areas of interest referred to in this
document or past assessment documents are shown.

(ref:main-overview-map-alt) This figure shows many ports and cities of
interest for the hake fishery.

(ref:main-acoustic-age2-bs-cap) Spatial distribution of acoustic backscatter
attributable to age-2 and older `r sp` from the `r survey_name`
(`r survey_start_yr`--`r survey_end_yr`). Area of the circle is roughly
proportional to observed backscatter. Bar plots show survey-estimated biomass
for ages 2 to 20, with major cohorts highlighted in color. Figure produced
by Julia Clemons (NOAA).

(ref:main-acoustic-age2-bs-alt) This figure shows that `r sp`  migrate further
north in some years

(ref:main-acoustic-age1-bs-cap) Spatial distribution of acoustic backscatter
attributable to aggregations of age-1 `r sp` from the `r survey_name`
2003--`r survey_end_yr` (spatial details are not available for survey years
1995, 1998, and 2001). Age-1 `r sp` are not fully sampled during the
acoustic survey and were not explicitly considered during establishment
of the survey sampling design. Additional backscatter from age-1 fish
intermixed with older fish is not shown. Area of the circle is roughly
proportional to observed backscatter. Figure produced by Julia Clemons (NOAA).

(ref:main-acoustic-age1-bs-alt) This figure shows the assumed varying
locations of age-1 `r sp`

(ref:main-catches-cap) Total `r sp` catch used in the assessment by sector,
`r start_yr`--`r last_data_yr`. U.S. tribal catches are included in the
sectors where they are represented.

(ref:main-catches-alt) This figure shows that catches in four of the last six
years have been the largest in the time series.

(ref:main-us-catch-rates-cap) Unstandardized (raw) catch-rates (t/hr) of 
`r sp` catches by tow in the U.S. at-sea fleet from
`r last_data_yr - 4`--`r last_data_yr`.

(ref:main-us-catch-rates-alt) This figure shows changes in catch rates for
the U.S. fleet. The rates are highest in September followed by May and June

(ref:main-us-depths-cap) Distribution of fishing depths (left) and bottom
depths (right), in meters, of hauls targeting `r sp` in the U.S.
Catcher-Processor and Mothership sectors from
`r last_data_yr - 4`--`r last_data_yr`. Horizontal lines in each box
represent the median depth and boxes encompass the middle 50% of the
data. Whiskers encompass the 95% quantiles.

(ref:main-us-depths-alt) This figure shows that bottom depths have been
approximately 500 meters and fishing depths approximately 300 meters on
average in the last 5 years for United States fleets

```{r main-us-depths-fig, fig.cap = "(ref:main-us-depths-cap)", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8, is.fig = TRUE, alt.text = "(ref:main-us-depths-alt)"}

```

(ref:main-can-depths-cap) Distribution of fishing depths (left) and bottom
depths (right), in meters, of hauls targeting `r sp` in the Canadian
fleets from `r last_data_yr - 4`--`r last_data_yr`. Horizontal lines in each
box represent the median depth and boxes encompass the middle 50% of the
data. Whiskers encompass the 95% quantiles.

(ref:main-can-depths-alt) This figure shows that for the last five years in Canada freezer trawlers fished at an approximate bottom depth of 400 meters and shoreside vessels fished at an approximate bottom depth of 200 meters. Freezer trawlers fished at a gear depth of approximately 200 meters and shoreside vessels at a depth of approximately 150 meters. In 2023 this changed somewhat with both fleets fishing closer to the bottom and in shallower water

```{r main-can-depths-fig, fig.cap = "(ref:main-can-depths-cap)", fig.height = 8, fig.width = 8, is.fig = TRUE, alt.text = "(ref:main-can-depths-alt)"}

(ref:main-data-overview-cap) Overview of data used in this assessment. Circle
areas are proportional to total catch for the fishery data, precision for
the indices, and total sample size for the age compositions (and cannot be
compared across data types). Additionally, mean weight-at-age data
(`r start_yr_age_comps`--`r last_data_yr`; not depicted here but see
Figure~\@ref(fig:main-empirical-weight-at-age-numbers-fig) for sample sizes)
are used to account for time-varying growth.

(ref:main-data-overview-alt) This figure gives an overview of the data used
in this assessment. Fishery catches span the whole time series from 1966 to
present. Fishery age compositions from 1975 to present were used and all data
from the age 2 plus acoustic survey were included. This includes the index of
abundance and age compositions from 1995 to present for odd years

```{r main-data-overview-fig, fig.cap = "(ref:main-data-overview-cap)", fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8, is.fig = TRUE, alt.text = "(ref:main-data-overview-alt)"}
plot_data_summary(base_model)
```

(ref:main-age-comp-bubbles-cap) Age compositions for the aggregate fishery
(top, all sectors combined) and acoustic survey (bottom) for the years
`r max_fishery_age_prop[1]`--`r max_fishery_age_prop[2]`. Proportions in
each year sum to 1.0 and area of the bubbles are proportional to the
proportion and consistent in both panels (see key at top). The largest
bubble in the fishery data is
`r f(as.numeric(max_fishery_age_prop[3]) / 100, 2)` for age
`r as.numeric(max_survey_age_prop[5])` in
`r as.numeric(max_fishery_age_prop[4])` and in the survey data is
`r f(as.numeric(max_survey_age_prop[3]) / 100, 2)` for age
`r as.numeric(max_survey_age_prop[5])` in
`r as.numeric(max_survey_age_prop[4])`. Red lines track large cohorts.

(ref:main-age-comp-bubbles-alt) This figure shows that there are currently
three large cohorts making their way through the stock. The 2010 cohort is
the largest followed by the 2014 cohort and the 2016 cohort. The 2020 cohort
is large but highly uncertain

```{r main-age-comp-bubbles-fig, fig.cap = "(ref:main-age-comp-bubbles-cap)", fig.height = 8, fig.width = 6, is.fig = TRUE, alt.text = "(ref:main-age-comp-bubbles-alt)", out.height = "\\textheight",  out.width = "\\textwidth"}

(ref:main-survey-extrap-biomass-cap) Acoustic survey biomass index of age-2+
fish (Mt, Table~\@ref(tab:main-survey-history-tab)). Approximate 95 confidence
intervals are based on sampling variability (intervals without squid/hake
apportionment uncertainty in 2009 are displayed in black).

(ref:main-survey-extrap-biomass-alt) This figure shows that the survey biomass
estimate has decreased from 2019 to 2021

```{r main-survey-extrap-biomass-fig,  fig.cap = "(ref:main-survey-extrap-biomass-cap)", fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8, is.fig = TRUE, alt.text = "(ref:main-survey-extrap-biomass-alt)"}
  plot_survey_biomass(base_model, index = "age2")
```

(ref:main-survey-age1-cap) Relative index of age-1 fish (numbers of fish,
Table~\@ref(tab:main-survey-history-tab)) and approximate 95% confidence
intervals based on sampling variability. The index is relative because
the survey does not attempt to sample all available age-1 fish and the
analysis does not include kriging as is done to estimate age-2+ biomass.

(ref:main-survey-age1-alt) This figure shows that the age-1 survey estimate
has increased from 2019 to 2021

```{r main-survey-age1-fig, fig.cap = "(ref:main-survey-age1-cap)", fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8, is.fig = TRUE, alt.text = "(ref:main-survey-age1-alt)"}
plot_survey_biomass(base_model, index = "age1", y_lim = c(0, 16))
```

(ref:main-maturity-ogive-cap) Fraction of fish that are mature at each age
north and south of 34.44\degree\ N (upper panel) and the fecundity
relationship (lower panel). The fecundity relationship (purple line) is
the product of the weight-at-age and the maturity-at-age for the samples
collected from North of 34.44\degree\ N (blue line in upper plot) averaged
across `r start_yr_age_comps` to `r last_data_yr`.

(ref:main-maturity-ogive-alt) This figure shows how maturity increases with
age. Fish appear to reach full maturity between the age of 3 and 4. South
of Point Conception which is at a latitude of 34.4 degrees they appear to
reach maturity between the age of 2 and 3

```{r main-maturity-ogive-fig, fig.cap = "(ref:main-maturity-ogive-cap)", fig.height = 11, fig.width = 8, out.height = "\\textheight", out.width = "\\textwidth", is.fig = TRUE, alt.text = "(ref:main-maturity-ogive-alt)"}
p_lst <- list()
p_lst[[1]] <- plot_maturity_ogives(base_model, maturity_samples_df)
p_lst[[2]] <- plot_fecundity(base_model,
               d = maturity_samples_df,
               yrs = start_yr_age_comps:(end_yr - 1))
plot_grid(plotlist = p_lst, ncol = 1)
```
(ref:main-weight-at-age-cap) Empirical weight-at-age (kg) values used for
the base model. Colors correspond to the values, with red being the lightest
fish (across all years and ages) and blue being the heaviest fish. For each
age, the most transparent cells indicate the lightest fish of that age. Data
are only available from `r start_yr_age_comps`--`r last_data_yr`. Values
based on assumptions for the pre-`r start_yr_age_comps` and forecast years
are shown outside the blue lines. Bold values between
`r start_yr_age_comps`--`r max_fishery_age_prop[2]` represent unavailable
data such that weights were interpolated or extrapolated from adjacent ages
or years. The bottom row (mean) is the sample-weighted mean weight-at-age
over all years of data.

(ref:main-weight-at-age-alt) This figure shows how weight-at-age changes
through time. The weight-at-age appears to have decreased overall from 1975
to present

```{r main-weight-at-age-fig, fig.cap = "(ref:main-weight-at-age-cap)", fig.height = 11, fig.width = 8, out.height = "\\textheight", out.width = "\\textwidth", is.fig = TRUE, alt.text = "(ref:main-weight-at-age-alt)"}
