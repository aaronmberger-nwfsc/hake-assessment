(ref:main-overview-map-cap) Overview map of the area in the Northeast Pacific
Ocean occupied by `r sp`. Ports and areas of interest referred to in this
document or past assessment documents are shown.

(ref:main-overview-map-alt) This figure shows many ports and cities of
interest for the hake fishery.

```{r main-overview-map-fig, fig.cap = "(ref:main-overview-map-cap)", is.fig = TRUE, alt.text = "(ref:main-overview-map-alt)", fig.height = 8, fig.width = 6, out.height = "\\textheight",  out.width = "\\textwidth"}

```

(ref:main-acoustic-age2-bs-cap) Spatial distribution of acoustic backscatter
attributable to age-2 and older `r sp` from the `r survey_name`
(`r survey_start_yr`--`r survey_end_yr`). Area of the circle is roughly
proportional to observed backscatter. Bar plots show survey-estimated biomass
for ages 2 to 20, with major cohorts highlighted in color. Figure produced
by Julia Clemons (NOAA).

(ref:main-acoustic-age2-bs-alt) This figure shows that `r sp`  migrate further
north in some years

(ref:main-acoustic-age1-bs-cap) Spatial distribution of acoustic backscatter
attributable to aggregations of age-1 `r sp` from the `r survey_name`
2003--`r survey_end_yr` (spatial details are not available for survey years
1995, 1998, and 2001). Age-1 `r sp` are not fully sampled during the
acoustic survey and were not explicitly considered during establishment
of the survey sampling design. Additional backscatter from age-1 fish
intermixed with older fish is not shown. Area of the circle is roughly
proportional to observed backscatter. Figure produced by Julia Clemons (NOAA).

(ref:main-acoustic-age1-bs-alt) This figure shows the assumed varying
locations of age-1 `r sp`

(ref:main-catches-cap) Total `r sp` catch used in the assessment by sector,
`r start_yr`--`r last_data_yr`. U.S. tribal catches are included in the
sectors where they are represented.

(ref:main-catches-alt) This figure shows that catches in four of the last six
years have been the largest in the time series.

(ref:main-us-catch-rates-cap) Unstandardized (raw) catch-rates (t/hr) of 
`r sp` catches by tow in the U.S. at-sea fleet from
`r last_data_yr - 4`--`r last_data_yr`.

(ref:main-us-catch-rates-alt) This figure shows changes in catch rates for
the U.S. fleet. The rates are highest in September followed by May and June

(ref:main-us-depths-cap) Distribution of fishing depths (left) and bottom
depths (right), in meters, of hauls targeting `r sp` in the U.S.
Catcher-Processor and Mothership sectors from
`r last_data_yr - 4`--`r last_data_yr`. Horizontal lines in each box
represent the median depth and boxes encompass the middle 50% of the
data. Whiskers encompass the 95% quantiles.

(ref:main-us-depths-alt) This figure shows that bottom depths have been
approximately 500 meters and fishing depths approximately 300 meters on
average in the last 5 years for United States fleets

```{r main-us-depths-fig, fig.cap = "(ref:main-us-depths-cap)", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8, is.fig = TRUE, alt.text = "(ref:main-us-depths-alt)"}

```

(ref:main-can-depths-cap) Distribution of fishing depths (left) and bottom
depths (right), in meters, of hauls targeting `r sp` in the Canadian
fleets from `r last_data_yr - 4`--`r last_data_yr`. Horizontal lines in each
box represent the median depth and boxes encompass the middle 50% of the
data. Whiskers encompass the 95% quantiles.

(ref:main-can-depths-alt) This figure shows that for the last five years in Canada freezer trawlers fished at an approximate bottom depth of 400 meters and shoreside vessels fished at an approximate bottom depth of 200 meters. Freezer trawlers fished at a gear depth of approximately 200 meters and shoreside vessels at a depth of approximately 150 meters. In 2023 this changed somewhat with both fleets fishing closer to the bottom and in shallower water

```{r main-can-depths-fig, fig.cap = "(ref:main-can-depths-cap)", fig.height = 8, fig.width = 8, is.fig = TRUE, alt.text = "(ref:main-can-depths-alt)"}
