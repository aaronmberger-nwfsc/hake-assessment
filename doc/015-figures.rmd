(ref:main-overview-map-cap) Overview map of the area in the Northeast Pacific
Ocean occupied by `r sp`. Ports and areas of interest referred to in this
document or past assessment documents are shown.

(ref:main-overview-map-alt) This figure shows many ports and cities of
interest for the hake fishery.

```{r main-overview-map-fig, fig.cap = "(ref:main-overview-map-cap)", is.fig = TRUE, alt.text = "(ref:main-overview-map-alt)", fig.height = 8, fig.width = 6, out.height = "\\textheight",  out.width = "\\textwidth"}
plot_overview_map(ports_df, states_df)
```

(ref:main-acoustic-age2-bs-cap) Spatial distribution of acoustic backscatter
attributable to age-2 and older `r sp` from the `r survey_name`
(`r survey_start_yr`--`r survey_end_yr`). Area of the circle is roughly
proportional to observed backscatter. Bar plots show survey-estimated biomass
for ages 2 to 20, with major cohorts highlighted in color. Figure produced
by Julia Clemons (NOAA).

(ref:main-acoustic-age2-bs-alt) This figure shows that `r sp`  migrate further
north in some years

(ref:main-acoustic-age1-bs-cap) Spatial distribution of acoustic backscatter
attributable to aggregations of age-1 `r sp` from the `r survey_name`
2003--`r survey_end_yr` (spatial details are not available for survey years
1995, 1998, and 2001). Age-1 `r sp` are not fully sampled during the
acoustic survey and were not explicitly considered during establishment
of the survey sampling design. Additional backscatter from age-1 fish
intermixed with older fish is not shown. Area of the circle is roughly
proportional to observed backscatter. Figure produced by Julia Clemons (NOAA).

(ref:main-acoustic-age1-bs-alt) This figure shows the assumed varying
locations of age-1 `r sp`

(ref:main-catches-cap) Total `r sp` catch used in the assessment by sector,
`r start_yr`--`r last_data_yr`. U.S. tribal catches are included in the
sectors where they are represented.

(ref:main-catches-alt) This figure shows that catches in four of the last six
years have been the largest in the time series.

```{r main-catches-fig, fig.cap = "(ref:main-catches-cap)", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8, is.fig = TRUE, alt.text = "(ref:main-catches-alt)"}
plot_catches(ct, leg.y.loc = 650)
