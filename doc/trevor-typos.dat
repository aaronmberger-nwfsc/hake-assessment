N [we discussed last year and I think concluded that Pacific whiting is not the common name, but a colloquial name; also re-ordered for clarity] - p. 22 ¡§Pacific Hake (or Pacific whiting¡¨ here whiting should be capitalized, presumably.
D [actually deleted to avoid repitition] - p. 24 ¡§Pacific Hake , also referred to as Pacific whiting ,¡¨ remove the spaces before each of the commas.
D - p. 24 ¡§family Merluccidae¡¨, the family name should not be in italics.

D - p. 31 ¡§nearly equal in 2016 .¡¨ delete the space before the period.
D [rephrase for clarity] - p. 35 ¡§782 individual ovary collections¡¨ does this mean 782 individual ovaries, or 782 sets of ovaries collected at different times?
D - p. 35 ¡§relative contribute to the female spawning biomass¡¨ should be ¡§contribution¡¨ not ¡§contribute¡¨
D - p. 35 ¡§At-Sea hake Observer¡¨ here ¡§Hake¡¨ should be capitalized.
D [actually 34.5deg N] -  p. 36 ¡§south of 34.5 degrees latitude¡¨ in two places, should be ¡§south of 34.5¢XS¡¨
N [I think we couldn't be sure, so said 'surely' as a qualifier] - p. 41 ¡§have surely been subject to¡¨ delete ¡§surely¡¨.
N [Ian: I think Trevor was just reading it too fast. Andy: admittedly not the most elegant sentence, but I'm not quite sure the issue - maybe 'invariant' should be 'time-invariant'?] p. 41 The sentence starting ¡§Selectivity has also been modeled in several ways: it has been invariant...¡¨ does not make grammatical sense.
D [and similarly in Exec Summary] p. 43 ¡§the the processing¡¨ remove the duplicated ¡§the¡¨.
D - p. 46 ¡§and to¡¥tune¡¦ the 2017 base model¡¨ add a space after ¡§to¡¨.

D - p. 49 ¡§2-year-old fish in the 2012¡¨ should be ¡§2-year-old fish in 2012¡¨

D [actually only 1999] - p. 50 ¡§in all years except and 1999¡¨ a year is missing after ¡§except¡¨.
D - p. 52 ¡§relative to 100% target¡¨ should be ¡§relative to the 100% target¡¨
D [the suggestion isn't accurate since our original is a bit unclear/misleading, so just going with "ranges from 17\% to 82\% depending on the catch level" - I think the original phrasing made more sense in previous documents when results were different and could more easily be summarised] p. 52 ¡§The probability that the 2018 spawning biomass will be less than the 2017 spawning biomass is 82% or less for all catch levels¡¨ Perhaps better to say: ¡§... is high, up to 82% depending on catch levels¡¨.
D - p. 53 ¡§2017 estimates at 74.2%¡¨ should perhaps be ¡§2017 estimates are 74.2%¡¨

N [not heard of this before, though my office neighbour has and agrees with the change! Not changing since we've probably used 'between' elsehwere, and dictionary says that 'between' can be two or more] p. 57 ¡§The variability between models¡¨ should be ¡§The variability among models¡¨ since there are more than two models being compared.

D [and automatically corrected in Exec Summary also] - p. 57 ¡§making sure that¡¨ should be ¡§make sure that¡¨
D - p. 62 ¡§Hakes of the world (family Merlucciidae).¡¨ Here the Merlucciidae should not be italicized since it is a family name and not a genus or species.
D - p. 62 ¡§an example of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua)¡¨ species name should be in italics ¡§Gadus morhua¡¨
N [Hard/impossible to do with the vertical lines, which are needed] Table 5: numbers should be right aligned.
D - Table 14: numbers should be right aligned.
Table 15: ¡§Log Rec. deviations¡¨ should be ¡§Log rec. deviations¡¨
Table 17: some columns have a space after the dash.
Table 20: final column, 27% and 24% should have a number after the decimal place.
Table 22: ¡§2017 ¡V 2019¡¨ no spaces on either side of the dash.
D - Figure 38: the upper bound of x-axis needs to be extended so that the 97.5% upper limit is shown.
D - [Fixed 40, 41, and 60, skipping plots dependent on r4ss for now] Figure 39, 40, 41, 47 and most of the later plots: remove the space between 0 and the axis on the y-axis.
