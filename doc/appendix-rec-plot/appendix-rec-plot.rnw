\chapter{New way to further convey recruitment variability}
\label{chap:rec-plot}

% Taking ideas from Issue #836.

This appendix contains some ideas to develop an extra figure to further convey
recruitment variability in an intuitive way.

\end{figure}

Variability in annual recruitment is a key feature of the \fishname\
stock. This is demonstrated  in figures of the estimated
recruitment of age-0 fish in each year, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:main-recruitment} and the equivalent
figure from the \Sexpr{assess.yr - 1} assessment \citep{JTC2021}, reproduced
below as Figure~\ref{fig:recruitment-last-asssessment}.

However, we realised that these figures may not clearly or intuitively convey
certain aspects. To understand this, the JTC sent a survey to all participants of
the \fishname\ process, who were asked to
anonymously answer the following question (via a Google Form that included a
copy of the relevant Figure~\ref{fig:recruitment-last-asssessment}):
\begin{quote}
``Figure e in the 2021 Pacific Hake stock assessment document
shows the estimated recruitment each year. From this figure
what do you think the chance (probability) is that the 2014 cohort is at least
as large as the 2010 cohort? Please give a percentage or a range, and feel
free to add any text if you like. All answers are anonymous. Thanks.''
\end{quote}

Survey results are given in Figure~\ref{fig:recruitment-answers}, showing
a wide range of answers. However, from the full MCMC results, the
estimated probability that `the 2014 cohort is at least
as large as the 2010 cohort` is in fact \Sexpr{prob.percent.2014.rec.gt.2010.rec}\%,
a value that was only considered by one respondent.
%
\begin{figure}[tbp]
\begin{center}
<<recruitment-answers, fig.height=4.5, fig.width=5, is.fig = TRUE, alt.text = "This figure shows the last three large cohorts' recruitment: 2010, 2014, and 2016">>=
make.rec.question.plot()
@
\end{center}
\caption{Results from 21 respondents giving their estimated
  probability, as a percentage, that the 2014 cohort is at least as large as the
  2010 cohort, based on Figure~\ref{fig:recruitment-last-asssessment}. Respondents
  gave either single estimates (dots) or a range (dots connected by lines). A further
  respondent answered `Low' (not shown), and an answer of 0.4 is assumed to mean 40\%
  (not 0.4\%).}
\label{fig:recruitment-answers}
\end{figure}
%
Therefore it seems appropriate to explain this discrepancy and to derive a
more intuitive figure to complement the existing figure.

%% [GOING to just use new results.**Andy will do: when have 2022 base model change the figures to last.yr.base.model not
%% base.model, so that this text is correct (and the figure is one we asked people
%% about). And go through text again (plus do some editing). Don't change final
%% one as want that based on the new base model, plus
%% will be interesting to compare to how it differs to last year's base model. OR
%% maybe just do them all for new base model if they look similar enough.]

% In issue I did: mean(base.model$mcmc$"Recr_2014" > base.model$mcmc$"Recr_2010")

The reason for asking about comparing the 2014 cohort to the 2010 cohort is that
the 2010 cohort is the largest for some time
(Figure~\ref{fig:recruitment-last-asssessment}), with 1999 looking somewhat
comparable. Thus, people familiar with \fishname\ have an intuition about the
2010 cohort being very large. Also, the probability that the 2014 cohort could
be as large as the 2010 cohort was explicitly calculated to be 4.8\% in the 2018
assessment \citep{JTC2018}; we return to this later.

Also, the y-axis in
Figure~\ref{fig:recruitment-last-asssessment} is in terms of billions of age-0
fish. While this is a sensible unit for recruitment, it may not be a very
intuitive scale. So it can be desirable to want to compare the size of cohorts
with the huge 2010 cohort, as people have some intuition regarding the 2010
cohort (i.e. that it was huge).

In Figure~\ref{fig:recruitment-last-asssessment} the credible interval for the
2014 recruitment extends above the median for the 2010 recruitment, and thus
intuitively it certainly appears that there is some (non-zero) chance that 2014
could be larger than 2010.
However, the reason that the estimated probability of the 2014 cohort being
larger than the 2010 cohort is \Sexpr{prob.percent.2014.rec.gt.2010.rec}\% is
because larger values of 2014 recruitment are associated with large values of
2010 recruitment. This is clear when looking at individual time series of
recruitment for a subsample of the MCMC samples
(Figures~\ref{fig:recruitment-trace-recent}
and~\ref{fig:recruitment-trace-recent-highlight}). [From here on we are using results
from this year's base model, since they are very similar to those from last year's
recruitment estimates (Figure~\ref{fig:recruitment-last-asssessment}), up until
2019 for which there is now more data].

\caption{As for Figure~\ref{fig:recruitment-trace-recent} but for just 10
  colour-coded samples to show their non-overlapping nature (this expectedly breaks down in
  the final years due to a lack of data and random sampling for the

\label{fig:recruitment-trace-recent-highlight}
\end{figure}

The individual samples in Figures~\ref{fig:recruitment-trace-recent}
and~\ref{fig:recruitment-trace-recent-highlight} rarely overlap, so that a high recruitment in 2010
corresponds to a high recruitment in 2014. This breaks down in the final years
(explained later).

To show this more clearly, we can divide each individual recruitment time series (MCMC
sample) by its
value for 2010 (Figure~\ref{fig:recruitment-trace-scale}). By definition, all
samples are 1 for 2010. Figure~\ref{fig:recruitment-trace-scale} shows that none
of the 2014 recruitments (for any of the 100 MCMC samples shown) reach the 2010
value.

%
By showing the same results (for all MCMC samples) in terms of medians and 95\%
credible intervals
(Figure~\ref{fig:recruitment-scale}), we can see that the 2014 recruitment is
definitely not coming close to the 2010 recruitment.

\label{fig:recruitment-scale-all}
\end{figure}

Showing the same results for all years (Figure~\ref{fig:recruitment-scale-all}), including
projection years,
we see that
%
\begin{itemize}
\item the 2014 cohort is definitely smaller than the 2010 cohort, whereas
  intution (Figure~\ref{fig:recruitment-answers}) from the usual plots is that it could possibly be as
  large as 2010;

\item there have only been two past recruitment events (1980 and 1984) that might be as large as 2010.
  Whereas Figure~\ref{fig:main-recruitment} also suggests that 1970, 1999 and 2014
  could possibly be that large, giving an
  over-optimistic impression of how often we can expect cohorts the size of the
  2010 cohort to occur.

\item with the limited data available, the 2020 cohort is expected to be above
  average, possibly as large as the 2010 cohort, but with a 50\% chance of being
  roughly only a third of the size of the 2010 cohort (from looking at where the
  median is for 2020).

\item there are no data to inform the 2021 recruitment, and so for that and the
  2022-2024 projection years, the model isallowing recruitments as large as
  2010, although half of the projected recruitments are very low (below the
  dots), as expected from the lognormal recruitment deviations used in the
  model.
\end{itemize}

The explicit MCMC subsamples for projection years
(Figures~\ref{fig:recruitment-trace-recent},
\ref{fig:recruitment-trace-recent-highlight}  and~\ref{fig:recruitment-trace-scale})
make it clear how the projection years do have recruitment time series that
cross each other. This is because the recruitment deviation for each MCMC sample
each year is based on a
random draw from the lognormal distribution stock recruitment (and then applied
to the stock-recruitment curve for that that MCMC sample, based on the sample's
estimated parameters). Since the random draws are independent from year to yet,
a large recruitment (from a large recruitment deviation) in one year does not
imply a large recruitment in the next year, unlke for the earlier years (and
shown explicitly in Figure~\ref{fig:recruitment-trace-recent-highlight}).

**The traceplot figures may also help when answering Issue \#843 (and SRG request), regarding Trevor's
idea about sampling from past recruitments for the projections. It looks (eyeballing it) that we're
covering the full range pretty well. Could do a quick analysis if necessary --
use the MCMC samples and compare with sampling from past recruitments.

In the 2018 assessment the probability that the 2014 cohort was larger
than the 2010 cohort was explicitly calculated to be
4.8\% \citep{JTC2018} (**also see Issue \#422). The only age composition data informing the size
of the 2014 cohort would have been from the fishery when the cohort
was of age 1, 2, and 3, and from the survey age when it was of age 3 (the 2017 survey).
Figure~e from 2018 has the median for 2014 above
the lower end of the 2010 credible interval (unlike
Figure~\ref{fig:main-recruitment}). Now that there are more data
available regarding the 2014 cohort (compared to the 2018 assessment) the
probability is
estimated to be \Sexpr{prob.percent.2014.rec.gt.2010.rec}\%.
More data allows for more certainty (less
uncertainty) in such a calculation, hence why the probability changes with later
assessments.
