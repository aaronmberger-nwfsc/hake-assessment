# One-page summary {-}

- The stock assessment model for `r assess_yr` has the same
population dynamics structure as the `r last_assess_yr` model.
The model is fit to an acoustic survey index of biomass, an
index of age-1 fish, annual commercial catch data, mean weight-at-age data,
and age-composition data from the survey and commercial fisheries.

- Updates to the data include:
<!-- the new biomass estimate and age-composition data from the acoustic survey conducted in `r survey_end_yr`, -->
fishery catch and age-composition data from `r end_yr-1`, weight-at-age data for
`r end_yr-1`,
<!-- the `r survey_end_yr` age-1 index estimate, -->
and minor changes to pre-`r end_yr-1` data.

- Coast-wide catch in `r end_yr-1` was `r last_yr_landings`~t
[t represents metric tons], 6% below the average over the most recent 10 years
(`r ct |> tail(10) |> pull(Total) |> mean() |> f()`~t),
out of a total allowable catch (TAC), adjusted for carryovers, of `r last_yr_tac` t.
The U.S. caught `r last_yr_us_landings`~t (`r last_yr_us_attained`% of their quota) and Canada caught `r last_yr_can_landings`~t
(`r last_yr_can_attained`% of their quota).

- The median estimate of the `r end_yr` relative spawning biomass
(female spawning biomass at the start of `r end_yr` divided by that at
unfished equilibrium, B~0~) is `r curr_depl_median`% but is highly
uncertain (with 95% credible interval from `r curr_depl_lower`% to
`r curr_depl_upper`%). The median relative spawning biomass
has increased since 2021, due to the estimated above average
2020 cohort entering maturity. The large,
but uncertain, size of the 2020 cohort is based on the 2021 age-1 index
estimate and the `r last_assess_yr` fishery age-composition data.

- The median estimate of female spawning biomass at the start
of `r end_yr` is `r curr_bio_median_tonnes`~t (with 95% credible
interval from `r curr_bio_lower_tonnes` to `r curr_bio_upper_tonnes`~t).
This is `r diff_bio_median_last_curr`% `r diff_bio_median_last_curr_text`
this assessment's median estimate for the `r end_yr-1` female spawning
biomass of `r prev_bio_median_tonnes`~t (with 95% credible interval
`r prev_bio_lower_tonnes`--`r prev_bio_upper_tonnes`~t).

- The estimated probability that female spawning biomass at the start of
`r assess_yr` is below the `r b_40` (40% of `r b_0`) reference point is
`r probs_curr_below_b40`%, and the probability that the relative fishing
intensity exceeded `r fspr_40` in `r end_yr - 1` is
`r probs_curr_rel_fish_intens_above_1`%. The joint
probability of both these occurring is `r joint_percent_prob_above_below`%.

- Based on the default harvest rule, the estimated median catch limit for
`r min(forecast_yrs)` is `r ct_limit_quantiles["median"]`~t (with
95% credible interval from `r ct_limit_quantiles["lower"]` to
`r ct_limit_quantiles["upper"]`~t).

- Projections were conducted across a wide-range of catch levels due to
high uncertainty in estimates of recent and forecasted recruitment.
Projections setting the `r forecast_yrs[1]` and
`r forecast_yrs[2]` catches equal to the `r forecast_yrs[1] - 1`
coast-wide TAC of `r last_yr_tac` t show the estimated median relative
spawning biomass decreasing from `r f(last_yr_tac_fore_1_biomass)`% in
`r end_yr` to `r f(last_yr_tac_fore_2_biomass)`% in `r end_yr + 1` to
`r f(last_yr_tac_fore_3_biomass)`% in `r end_yr + 2`,
with a `r last_yr_tac_risk_2_bforty`% chance
of the female spawning biomass falling below `r b_40` in `r end_yr + 2`.
There is an estimated `r last_yr_tac_risk_1_biomass_decline`% chance of the
female spawning biomass declining from `r end_yr` to `r end_yr + 1`, an
`r last_yr_tac_risk_2_biomass_decline`% chance of it declining from
`r end_yr + 1` to `r end_yr + 2`, and an
`r last_yr_tac_risk_3_biomass_decline`% chance of it declining for these
constant catches.
