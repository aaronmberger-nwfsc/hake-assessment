  The thin blue lines are the results of a random subset of individual MCMC samples.
  Thicker uncertainty intervals around observed survey points indicate 95\%
  log-normal uncertainty intervals estimated by the kriging method and are used as input to the assessment model.
  Thinner uncertainty intervals indicate estimated 95\% uncertainty intervals that account for the
  model estimate of additional uncertainty.}

together with the derived time series of spawning biomass and relative spawning biomass.
The level of autocorrelation in the chain (distribution across lag times, i.e., distance between samples in the chain, shown in the top left panel) influences the effective sample size (top right panel) used to estimate posterior distributions. The Geweke statistic (lower left panel) tests for equality between means located in the first part of the chain against means in the last part of the chain. The Heidelberger and Welch statistic (lower right panel) tests if the sampled values come from a stationary distribution by comparing different sections of the chain.}

A factor close to 1 indicates that between chain variance and within chain variance are equal. Values much greater than 1.1 indicate a notable difference between chains and the possible lack of achieving a converged stationary posterior distribution.}
