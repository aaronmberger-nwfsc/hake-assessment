# Report of the `r assess_yr - 1` `r sp` fishery in the United States {#sec:app-us-fishery-report}

**Prepared by the United States Advisory Panel on 24 January 2025 for inclusion in this assessment document.**

**2024 U.S. Sector Whiting Allocations & Catch**
Based on information provided by U.S. Advisory Panel members and data from
the Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN), total U.S. harvest in the
2024 whiting fishery was **165,582~t** (see Table \@ref(tab:us-ap-catch-tab)), which is 40% of the U.S. allocation of
410,035~t. Compared to the 2023 season (240,189~t), total U.S. catch was down
31% in 2024.

The **lack of a Spring fishery for all sectors** is one of the primary factors contributing to the
low overall catch for the U.S. whiting fishery in 2024. It seems the hake were slow to show up
(similar to 2023), and aggregation of fish observed in the Spring were located very far south,
and, in many cases not feasible to pursue (due to cost/economics or regulation). The spring fishery
was considered a failure for the catcher-processor (CP) sector, and boats in all sectors saw little
to no fish north of 42 degrees through most of the spring. The mothership (MS) and shoreside (SS)
vessels were able to get a few scratchy trips in June, but the fishery didn’t start in earnest until
July. Abnormally cold water temperatures were also reported in the Spring fishery, which did benefit
fish quality compared to 2023.

**Late summer into early fall** (August – October) provided the best fishing of the season. The
MS and SS fleets reported notably good, clean fishing in August and September. Fish aggregations
moved northward from the CA/OR border north of Newport, OR. The fish were consistently 500-600 grams
with good quality and recovery. By the end of September, catch began to slow, and fish size had
dropped to the 300-400g range, on average. Most of the MS and SS effort was in mid to southern
Oregon, with some catch in northern Oregon and Washington in October. Off northern OR and WA,
fishing was spottier across the entire year. Some SS boats had success finding hake in the box
off Northern Washington later in the year. Most fish caught of WA waters were larger fish, in
the 700-900 gram range and larger.

The CP sector began participating in the Fall fishery in late August/early September, which is a
typical timeframe. At no point in the fall season did the CP sector have a full complement of
vessels participating at the same time. This is due to some vessels returning from the Alaska
pollock fishery late, shipyard schedules, and poor fishing. Early in the fall season, strong
aggregations of whiting were observed in California, however it did not appear that fish moved
north across the OR/CA border. CP vessels generally encountered low CPUE in the Fall fishery
and difficulty finding consistent aggregations of whiting resulting in significant efforts
searching for whiting. Most CP harvest occurred in central and southern Oregon.

Bycatch was less of a problem than in most years, largely due to reduced catch and effort overall.
Many MS and SS catcher boats use real time cameras and did report seeing very large numbers of
small/juvenile hake in their cameras – Some fishermen reported seeing more 1 and 2 year olds
than they’ve seen in more than a decade. Boats in the pink shrimp fishery also reported seeing
large numbers of juvenile hake.

Only two (2) out of six (6) mothership platforms participated in the U.S. whiting fishery in 2024.
The shoreside sector continued to see reduced processing capacity with the loss of the Newport
surimi plants for the 2024 season.
