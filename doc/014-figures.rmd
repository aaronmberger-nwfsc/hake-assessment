(ref:main-overview-map-cap) Overview map of the area in the Northeast Pacific
Ocean occupied by `r sp`. Ports and areas of interest referred to in this
document or past assessment documents are shown.

(ref:main-overview-map-alt) This figure shows many ports and cities of
interest for the hake fishery.

(ref:main-acoustic-age2-bs-cap) Spatial distribution of acoustic backscatter
attributable to age-2 and older `r sp` from the `r survey_name`
(`r survey_start_yr`--`r survey_end_yr`). Area of the circle is roughly
proportional to observed backscatter. Bar plots show survey-estimated biomass
for ages 2 to 20, with major cohorts highlighted in color. Figure produced
by Julia Clemons (NOAA).

(ref:main-acoustic-age2-bs-alt) This figure shows that `r sp`  migrate further
north in some years.

(ref:main-acoustic-age1-bs-cap) Spatial distribution of acoustic backscatter
attributable to aggregations of age-1 `r sp` from the `r survey_name`
2003--`r survey_end_yr` (spatial details are not available for survey years
1995, 1998, and 2001). Age-1 `r sp` are not fully sampled during the
acoustic survey and were not explicitly considered during establishment
of the survey sampling design. Additional backscatter from age-1 fish
intermixed with older fish is not shown. Area of the circle is roughly
proportional to observed backscatter. Figure produced by Julia Clemons (NOAA).

(ref:main-acoustic-age1-bs-alt) This figure shows the assumed varying
locations of age-1 `r sp`.

(ref:main-catches-cap) Total `r sp` catch used in the assessment by sector,
`r start_yr`--`r last_data_yr`. U.S. tribal catches are included in the
sectors where they are represented.

(ref:main-catches-alt) This figure shows that catches in four of the last six
years have been the largest in the time series.

(ref:main-us-catch-rates-cap) Unstandardized (raw) catch-rates (t/hr) of 
`r sp` catches by tow in the U.S. at-sea fleet from
`r last_data_yr - 4`--`r last_data_yr`.

(ref:main-us-catch-rates-alt) This figure shows changes in catch rates for
the U.S. fleet. The rates are highest in September followed by May and June.

(ref:main-us-depths-cap) Distribution of fishing depths (left) and bottom
depths (right), in meters, of hauls targeting `r sp` in the U.S.
Catcher-Processor and Mothership sectors from
`r last_data_yr - 4`--`r last_data_yr`. Horizontal lines in each box
represent the median depth and boxes encompass the middle 50% of the
data. Whiskers encompass the 95% quantiles.

(ref:main-us-depths-alt) This figure shows that bottom depths have been
approximately 500 meters and fishing depths approximately 300 meters on
average in the last 5 years for United States fleets.

```{r main-us-depths-fig, fig.cap = "(ref:main-us-depths-cap)", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8, is.fig = TRUE, alt.text = "(ref:main-us-depths-alt)"}

(ref:main-can-depths-cap) Distribution of fishing depths (left) and bottom
depths (right), in meters, of hauls targeting `r sp` in the Canadian
fleets from `r last_data_yr - 4`--`r last_data_yr`. Horizontal lines in each
box represent the median depth and boxes encompass the middle 50% of the
data. Whiskers encompass the 95% quantiles.

(ref:main-can-depths-alt) This figure shows that for the last five years in
Canada freezer trawlers fished at an approximate bottom depth of 400 meters
and shoreside vessels fished at an approximate bottom depth of 200 meters.
Freezer trawlers fished at a gear depth of approximately 200 meters and
shoreside vessels at a depth of approximately 150 meters. In 2023 this
changed somewhat with both fleets fishing closer to the bottom and in
shallower water.

(ref:main-data-overview-cap) Overview of data used in this assessment. Circle
areas are proportional to total catch for the fishery data, precision for
the indices, and total sample size for the age compositions (and cannot be
compared across data types). Additionally, mean weight-at-age data
(`r start_yr_age_comps`--`r last_data_yr`; not depicted here but see
Figure~\@ref(fig:main-empirical-weight-at-age-numbers-fig) for sample sizes)
are used to account for time-varying growth.

(ref:main-data-overview-alt) This figure gives an overview of the data used
in this assessment. Fishery catches span the whole time series from 1966 to
present. Fishery age compositions from 1975 to present were used and all data
from the age 2 plus acoustic survey were included. This includes the index of
abundance and age compositions from 1995 to present for odd years.

```{r main-data-overview-fig, fig.cap = "(ref:main-data-overview-cap)", fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8, is.fig = TRUE, alt.text = "(ref:main-data-overview-alt)"}

(ref:main-age-comp-bubbles-cap) Age compositions for the aggregate fishery
(top, all sectors combined) and acoustic survey (bottom) for the years
`r max_fishery_age_prop[1]`--`r max_fishery_age_prop[2]`. Proportions in
each year sum to 1.0 and area of the bubbles are proportional to the
proportion and consistent in both panels (see key at top). The largest
bubble in the fishery data is
`r f(as.numeric(max_fishery_age_prop[3]) / 100, 2)` for age
`r as.numeric(max_survey_age_prop[5])` in
`r as.numeric(max_fishery_age_prop[4])` and in the survey data is
`r f(as.numeric(max_survey_age_prop[3]) / 100, 2)` for age
`r as.numeric(max_survey_age_prop[5])` in
`r as.numeric(max_survey_age_prop[4])`. Red lines track large cohorts.

(ref:main-age-comp-bubbles-alt) This figure shows that there are currently
three large cohorts making their way through the stock. The 2010 cohort is
the largest followed by the 2014 cohort and the 2016 cohort. The 2020 cohort
is large but highly uncertain.

```{r main-age-comp-bubbles-fig, fig.cap = "(ref:main-age-comp-bubbles-cap)", fig.height = 8, fig.width = 6, is.fig = TRUE, alt.text = "(ref:main-age-comp-bubbles-alt)", out.height = "\\textheight",  out.width = "\\textwidth"}

(ref:main-survey-extrap-biomass-cap) Acoustic survey biomass index of age-2+
fish (Mt, Table~\@ref(tab:main-survey-history-tab)). Approximate 95 confidence
intervals are based on sampling variability (intervals without squid/hake
apportionment uncertainty in 2009 are displayed in black).

(ref:main-survey-extrap-biomass-alt) This figure shows that the survey biomass
estimate has decreased from 2019 to 2021.

```

(ref:main-survey-age1-cap) Relative index of age-1 fish (numbers of fish,
Table~\@ref(tab:main-survey-history-tab)) and approximate 95% confidence
intervals based on sampling variability. The index is relative because
the survey does not attempt to sample all available age-1 fish and the
analysis does not include kriging as is done to estimate age-2+ biomass.

(ref:main-survey-age1-alt) This figure shows that the age-1 survey estimate
has increased from 2019 to 2021.

```{r main-survey-age1-fig, fig.cap = "(ref:main-survey-age1-cap)", fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8, is.fig = TRUE, alt.text = "(ref:main-survey-age1-alt)"}

```

(ref:main-maturity-ogive-cap) Fraction of fish that are mature at each age
north and south of 34.44\degree\ N (upper panel) and the fecundity
relationship (lower panel). The fecundity relationship (purple line) is
the product of the weight-at-age and the maturity-at-age for the samples
collected from North of 34.44\degree\ N (blue line in upper plot) averaged
across `r start_yr_age_comps` to `r last_data_yr`.

(ref:main-maturity-ogive-alt) This figure shows how maturity increases with
age. Fish appear to reach full maturity between the age of 3 and 4. South
of Point Conception which is at a latitude of 34.4 degrees they appear to
reach maturity between the age of 2 and 3.

```{r main-maturity-ogive-fig, fig.cap = "(ref:main-maturity-ogive-cap)", fig.height = 11, fig.width = 8, out.height = "\\textheight", out.width = "\\textwidth", is.fig = TRUE, alt.text = "(ref:main-maturity-ogive-alt)"}

```
(ref:main-weight-at-age-cap) Empirical weight-at-age (kg) values used for
the base model. Colors correspond to the values, with red being the lightest
fish (across all years and ages) and blue being the heaviest fish. For each
age, the most transparent cells indicate the lightest fish of that age. Data
are only available from `r start_yr_age_comps`--`r last_data_yr`. Values
based on assumptions for the pre-`r start_yr_age_comps` and forecast years
are shown outside the blue lines. Bold values between
`r start_yr_age_comps`--`r max_fishery_age_prop[2]` represent unavailable
data such that weights were interpolated or extrapolated from adjacent ages
or years. The bottom row (mean) is the sample-weighted mean weight-at-age
over all years of data.

(ref:main-weight-at-age-alt) This figure shows how weight-at-age changes
through time. The weight-at-age appears to have decreased overall from 1975
to present.

(ref:main-sample-size-weight-at-age-cap) Sample sizes of empirical
weight-at-age measurements used to calculate mean weight-at-age fit in
the base model. Colors and transparency are identical to
Figure~\@ref(fig:main-weight-at-age-fig) and based on mean values.
Sample sizes of zero highlight years for which data are not available, i.e.,
pre `r start_yr_age_comps` and post `r last_data_yr`. The total sample
sizes for each age used in the mean over all data years are shown at the
bottom and year-specific sample sizes are shown to the right using the same
color scale with red indicating small sample sizes and blue indicating the
large sample sizes.

(ref:main-sample-size-weight-at-age-alt) This figure shows the sample sizes
of weight-at-age vary between years and ages with the most samples occurring
for ages 3 through 7.

(ref:main-weight-at-age-lines-cap) Empirical mean weight-at-age (kg) values
for ages 2--10 used for the base model, as in
Figure~\@ref(fig:main-weight-at-age-fig) but shown as time series. Blue
lines are for the youngest ages and green lines are for the oldest ages
shown, with age-5 having a thicker line and larger points as a visual aid.

(ref:main-weight-at-age-lines-alt) This figure shows that the annual mean
weight-at-age is lower for most ages in the most recent years than for years
prior to 1980. There is a trend of increasing weight-at-age for the last
6 to 7 years.

```{r main-weight-at-age-lines-fig, fig.cap = "(ref:main-weight-at-age-lines-cap)", fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8, is.fig = TRUE, alt.text = "(ref:main-weight-at-age-lines-alt)"}

(ref:main-bridge-summary-cap) Bridging models showing the sequential steps
made to the base model from the `r last_assess_yr` base model to the
`r assess_yr` base model. In order the steps are: update the Stock Synthesis
model code version, add `r last_data_yr` catch, add `r last_data_yr`
weight-at-age, and add `r last_data_yr` fishery age compositions. The
final model is the base model for `r assess_yr`. Panels are spawning
biomass (upper panel), relative spawning biomass (spawning biomass in
each year relative to the unfished equilibrium spawning biomass, middle
left), recruitment deviation (middle right), age-2+ survey biomass index
(lower left), and age-1 index (lower right), with triangles representing
the observed survey indices.

(ref:main-bridge-summary-alt) This figure shows the differences between
the first bridging models for various model outputs. The only notable
difference is in the recruitment deviation estimates for 2020 to 2022 for
the bridging model where the 2022 catch is added.

(ref:main-survey-index-fit-mcmc-cap) Fits (colored lines) to the acoustic
survey (points) with input 95% intervals around the observations. The
thin blue lines are the results of a random subset of individual MCMC samples.
Thicker uncertainty intervals around observed survey points indicate 95%
lognormal uncertainty intervals estimated by the kriging method and are
used as input to the assessment model. Thinner uncertainty intervals
indicate estimated 95% uncertainty intervals that account for the model
estimate of additional uncertainty.

(ref:main-survey-index-fit-mcmc-alt) This figure shows 1000 posterior
trajectories of the expected survey biomass fitting well to the observed
biomass. The lines are very tightly packed together for most of the time
series but diverge a little near the end of the time series from about 2017
to 2021.

of a random subset of individual MCMC samples. Thicker uncertainty
intervals around observed survey points indicate 95% lognormal uncertainty
intervals based on sampling variability and are used as input to the
assessment model. Thinner uncertainty intervals indicate estimated 95%
uncertainty intervals that account for the model estimate of additional
uncertainty.

(ref:main-age1-index-fit-mcmc-alt) This figure shows many posterior
trajectories of the expected numbers of age-1 fish fitting well to the
age-1 index.The lines are very tightly packed together for most of the
time series but diverge a little at the end of the time series for the
2021 index point.

(ref:main-age-comp-fits-cap) Base model fits to the observed fishery (top)
and acoustic survey (bottom) age-composition data. Colored bars show
observed proportions with colors following each cohort across years. Points
with intervals indicate median expected proportions and 95% credibility
intervals from the MCMC calculations.

(ref:main-age-comp-fits-alt) This figure shows the age composition fits for
the fishery and acoustic survey against the data. There is some slight over
and under-fitting in the early part of the fishery time series from 1975 to
1995. The survey shows some over fitting from 2001 to 2005.

(ref:main-age-comp-pearson-cap) Pearson residuals for base model fits to
the age-composition data for the medians of the MCMC posteriors. Closed
bubbles are positive residuals (observed > expected) and open bubbles are
negative residuals (observed < expected). Red lines track cohorts from years
of large recruitment events.

(ref:main-age-comp-pearson-alt) This figure shows that there are no obvious
patterns in the Pearson residuals for the fishery and the survey.

(ref:main-prior-posterior-cap) Prior (black lines) and posterior (gray
histograms) distributions for natural mortality ($M$), equilibrium log
recruitment ($\ln R_0)$, steepness ($h$), the additional process-error
standard deviation (SD) for the acoustic survey, and the Dirichlet-multinomial
parameters for the fishery ($\theta_{\text{fish}}$) and the survey
($\theta_{\text{surv}}$). Red triangles signify the initial value for each
parameter. The small downturns at the ends of the uniform priors for $ln(R_0)$
and the Survey extra SD parameter represent the hard limits set for the prior
in the Stock Synthesis control file.
  
(ref:main-prior-posterior-alt) This figure shows how the posteriors shift
from the priors for key parameters. The steepness parameter appears to have
an almost identical prior and posterior distribution.
