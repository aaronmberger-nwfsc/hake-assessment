# Hake-specific ecosystem report {#sec:app-ecosystem-report}

Contributed by Kristin N. Marshall, Mary E. Hunsicker, and Andrew M. Edwards

The base model for this stock assessment includes
year-specific maturity-at-age that explicitly accounts for changes in temperature, and
empirical weight-at-age data that may be due to ecosystem effects. As such, the
assessment is consistent with an `Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries
Management' TODO add ref related to Jenny's talk if Bridget has something. To further this, here we
present further relevant ecosystem information that has been previously
found to influence `r sp` recruitment [@VestfalsEtAl2023].
We focus on easily-available and updatable
information, and what is presented here is not exhaustive. As such it should be
considered a first step in providing an operational summary of relevant
ecosystem information for `r sp`. We then present a NOAA-style risk table (TODO
get ref, see document).

## Ecosystem variables relevant for recruitment

We present some of the indicators that @VestfalsEtAl2023 found to lead to higher
`r sp` recruitment (Table \@ref(tab:app-ecosystem-report-indicators-tab)). That
analysis used estimated hake recruitment up to 2010, based on results in
the @JTC2020 hake assessment, although we conducted a preliminary update of
that study using more recent recruitment estimates and found some differences in
conclusions. TODO: Kristin to say if that last bit is okay.

TODO decide on consistent order (figure also). Fix ref in caption.

Asked Kristin if these are correct (need for my code - maybe I should switch to
the proper ones):
Tspawn - TEMPspawn
SSHjac - SSH_jac (this matches)
LSTegg - CST_eggs.s or CST_eggs.n or AST_eggs ?   Change variable name in
pacea ecosystem-summary-hake-glorys.R when confirmed.
PUTlate - PU_latelarv
MLDlate - MLD_latelarv

## Ecosystem and Environmental Conditions (need to update, write last, this is sablefish)

We evaluated recent trends in environmental drivers of sablefish recruitment and growth, predators, and prey, along with the climate vulnerability assessment (CVA) rank assigned to hake by McClure et al. (2023). We did not consider competitors, habitat, or non-fisheries human activities (such as offshore wind development) during this evaluation. Overall, we consider ecosystem and environmental conditions to be neutral (Level 2) for hake, with medium to high confidence, based on medium agreement among indicators and robust evidence. Recent trends in prey abundance have been positive and the evidence for this trend is robust. However, other indices (potential negative impacts of El Niño and a moderate CVA rank) do not portend favorable conditions for hake productivity, though the evidence for these indicators is not as strong.
Environmental drivers
Recruitment
Over the past three years, environmental conditions in the California Current Ecosystem have been largely warmer than average even with the backdrop of a prolonged La Niña event, which provided favorable recruitment conditions.

[relates to 2023-2024] Overall, these data suggest a XX in stock productivity in
coming years, (in)consistent with the assessment model. However, forecasts
suggest an intensifying El Niño during fall 2023/winter 2024. During El Niño
events that impact the California Current Ecosystem, upwelling is generally
weaker (Jacox et al. 2015), and northern copepod populations are generally
lower. These changes have the potential to negatively impact hake recruitment
(Vestfals et al. 2023).

Hake distribution

Predators and prey
Hake is common in many predator’s diets (e.g., Albacore, arrowtooth flounder, sharks (common and bigeye thresher, blue), swordfish (broadbill), CA sea lion, harbor seal, humboldt squid, northern fur seal, dolphins, pacific hake, jack mackerel, spiny dogfish, sablefish, shortspine thornyhead).  Recent trends (i.e. over the last 5 years) in these populations of hake predators are stable or increasing, suggesting mild concern about increased predation. We assume that long term trends, in particular those related to recovery of marine mammals over several decades, are implicitly represented in the stock assessment and do not represent notable changes that warrant inclusion in the risk table. However, recent indices of prey abundance are favorable. Krill is a dominant diet item for juveniles and adult hake (Wippel et al. 2017, Phillips et al. 2022, Bizzarro et al. 2023). The CCIEA krill indicator shows an increasing trend over the last five years.
CVA results
Hake are highly exposed with low sensitivity to climate change, with an overall rank of low (McClure et al. 2023).  However, we note that the CVA work pre-dates recent studies on the relationships between hake distribution and recruitment and ocean conditions (Malick et al. 2020, Vestfals et al. 2023).
