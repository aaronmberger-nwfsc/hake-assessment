\chapter{Sensitivity run that excludes the age-1 survey}
\label{chap:age1-survey}

This appendix contains Bayesian MCMC results for the model run in which the age-1
survey index is excluded as an index of recruitment as described in
Sections~\ref{sec:data-acoustic-survey} and \ref{sec:assessment-sensitivity-analyses}
(also see Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1}).
It highlights
model uncertainty arising from a different structural assumption or analytical choice
compared to the base model, and the exclusion of the age-1 index was deemed
important enough to warrant further consideration, especially in the context of characterizing
forecast uncertainty, and given it was excluded in the base model for previous assessments.
Nonetheless, this appendix is meant to provide supplemental information,
and should not be viewed as an alternative base model.
The figures and tables show results from this sensitivity run (plus
Figure~\ref{fig:age-one-index-age1-base} for the base model, as noted in its caption).

**Need to update the next paragraph depending on final results. Current results (with
diagnostics issue) give high 2020 recruitment without age-1, so it's not just
age-1 index driving that. That might help counter our previous warning below.

**[2021 assessment text] The estimated size of the 2010 and 2014 year classes when using only data when that
cohort is age-2 is closer to the final estimated size when excluding the age-1 index
(Figure~\ref{fig:retrospective-recruitment-age1}) than it is for the base model
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-retrospective-recruitment}). In terms of general year class strength,
the main difference between models is with the 2018 year class where the age-1 index estimates
it to be near average in size whereas the base model estimates to be well below average
(Figures~\ref{fig:retrospective-recruitment-age1} and~\ref{fig:main-retrospective-recruitment}).
Despite possible advantages in some
instances, previous comparisons with the age-1 survey
sensitivity have indicated that its use could lead to misleading results. For example,
the perception of the 2008 year class was higher in 2011 (near 20\%) and 2012 (near 100\%)
retrospectively when using the age-1 survey sensitivity instead of the base model.
Given that the stock was in a low biomass state in 2011 and 2012, including the
age-1 index at that time would have given misleadingly optimistic forecasts.
% To get exact numbers could run Kelli's code for each model, but I just
%  eyeballed the numbers which I think is fine:
% retro.list <- list(base.model)
% for(i in 1:5){     # was plot.retro.yrs but that's got changed somewhere
%  retro.list[[i + 1]] <- base.model$retros[[i]]
% }
% xx <- r4ss::SSsummarize(retro.list)
% xx$recruits[xx$recruits$Yr %in% 2008, ]

%The inclusion of the age-1 index does not greatly change the uncertainty of
%historical or forecast spawning biomass
%(Figure~\ref{fig:retrospective-biomass-base-age1}); this is also true for the
%retrospective runs. Overall, it
%appears that the inclusion of the age-1 index does not consistently improve estimates of
%recruitments, and, in fact, can be overly optimistic in some situations (Figure~\ref{fig:retrospective-2008-base-age1}).
%Recall that the survey design is not structured specifically for indexing age-1
%fish.


**Mention Figures~\ref{fig:age-one-index-age1-base} and~-ref{fig:age-one-index-age1}
Figures \ref{fig:spawning-biomass-age1}--\ref{fig:forecast-risk-comparison-year-2-age1}
and
Tables~\ref{tab:biomass-age1}--\ref{tab:risk-year-2-age1}
show further quantities of interest and decision tables from the MCMC results
when excluding the age-1 index.
