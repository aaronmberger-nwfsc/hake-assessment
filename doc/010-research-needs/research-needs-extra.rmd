<!-- All but the first three are here. The first three are in research-needs.rmd -->
4. Use, build, and expand upon the existing management strategy evaluation
framework to evaluate major sources of uncertainty relating to data, model
structure, and the harvest policy for this fishery (as needed) and compare
potential methods to address them. In particular, utilize and adapt the
management strategy evaluation framework to address new and ongoing stock
assessment research and data needs through the Pacific Hake Management
Strategy Evaluation Working Group, including relevant requests by the
Scientific Review Group (see Section~\@ref(sec:assessment-response-review)).
For example, research investigating links between `r sp` biomass, spatial
distribution, growth, recruitment, and natural mortality, and how these
biological processes vary with ocean conditions and ecosystem variables such
as temperature, transport, and prey availability could inform models used in
the MSE. Ongoing investigations have the potential to improve the scenarios
considered in future work on the MSE framework and the basic understanding of
drivers of `r sp` population dynamics and availability to fisheries and
surveys.

5. Complete the ongoing inter-laboratory otolith exchange and use the results
to update estimates of ageing error used in the stock assessment. This would
include updated information about ageing imprecision, the effects of large
cohorts, and comparisons between ageing methods such as break and burn, surface
reads, and Fourier-Transform Near Infrared Spectroscopy. The last
inter-laboratory comparison was done in 2010 ('CARE' exchanges). Related,
streamlining procedures that ease the exchange of biological materials (e.g.,
otoliths) across international borders would increase the efficiency at which
research products can be produced.

6. Improve stock assessment forecasts through research that identifies
linkages between `r sp` biology and ecosystem, oceanographic, or climate
variables across the population domain. In particular, explore possible
relationships with recruitment, growth, fecundity (including weight-at-age
and maturity), and population density to improve biomass forecasting
capabilities for `r sp`.

7. Explore the operational use of environmental DNA data for characterizing
aspects of `r sp` population dynamics, such as changes in species distribution
or density and the incorporation of these data into the assessment. Recent
research demonstrated that environmental DNA provides similar information as
the acoustic survey at scales relevant to management, i.e., coast-wide and not
just sample-to-sample comparisons [@SheltonRamonLacaEtAl2022], but longer time
series are needed before the data can be used to inform trends in abundance.
Environmental DNA is now available for 2019, 2021,and 2023 (three years total).
Continuing to extend the time series would allow for its incorporation in
future stock assessments as a relative index of abundance.

8. Explore alternative approaches and related assumptions for parameterizing
time-varying fishery selectivity in the assessment. Simulations that evaluate
methods for including multiple variance structures, including interactions,
tradeoffs, and related assumptions, across multiple processes (e.g.,
selectivity, recruitment, data weighting) in integrated stock assessment
models would be particularly beneficial.

9. Explore the potential to use acoustic data collected from commercial
fishing vessels to study `r sp` distributions, schooling patterns, and other
questions of interest. This could be similar to the 'acoustic vessels of
opportunity' program on fishing vessels targeting Pollock in Alaska
[@StienessenHonkalehtoEtAl2019].
