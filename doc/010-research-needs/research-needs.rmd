There are many research projects that could improve the stock assessment for
`r sp` and lead to improved biological understanding and decision-making. The
most important are as follows:

1. Continue to conduct research to evaluate ways to improve recent, current,
and future estimates of recruitment for use in stock assessment. This could
include the development of time series of recruitment indices, time series of
informative environmental or ecosystem variables, and models that have
predictive skill [e.g., @VestfalsEtAl2023]. Explorations should also consider
options for incorporating information on recruitment into the assessment model
and the management framework for `r sp`. For example, time series could be
included in the stock assessment as a standalone data source (similar to the
acoustic indices) or improvements could be made to the modeling framework
such that these environmental time series could impact the stock--recruitment
relationship directly. Results from such work should be connected to or in
cooperation with ongoing research related to recruitment variability as discussed
in Section~\@ref(sec:assessment-response-review). Related, there is a need to
streamline and broaden the availability of products from oceanographic models
(e.g., Regional Ocean Modeling System) so they are available across
international boundaries and updated on a recurring basis, thereby allowing for
their use as informative links in operational stock assessments. A successful
example of this has been the annual production of `r sp` distribution forecasts
that depend on 6--9 month forecasts of subsurface (i.e., 100 m depth)
temperature from [J-SCOPE](http://www.nanoos.org/products/j-scope/home.php).
Furthermore, the existing management strategy evaluation framework should be
used, or further developed, to examine how information on recruitment can
inform robust management decisions.

2. Conduct research on estimates of uncertainty for the relative age-1 index
and the age-2$+$ index and investigate alternative ways to utilize survey
age-composition information in the assessment model. Bootstrapping of the
acoustic survey time series, or related methods, could help incorporate
uncertainty related to the target-strength relationship, subjective scoring of
echograms, thresholding methods, and methods used to estimate the species mixes
for interpreting the acoustic backscatter into the variance calculations.
Research should be communicated with those involved in developing the U.S. West
Coast Integrated Survey Initiative. The management strategy evaluation
framework should be used, or further developed, to examine how changes in
survey methods can be used to inform robust management decisions.

1. Work with regional partners to develop an annual workflow that provides key
metrics, indicators, or other summaries of general ecosystem conditions
relevant to the coast-wide population of `r sp`.  In particular, include
indicators that are potentially associated with `r sp` biology and ecology
(e.g., recruitment, distribution, predation, prey, and communities). Such
information can broaden the context within which a single species stock
assessment is interpreted, be used to support model development, refine
uncertain assessment conclusions (e.g., productivity), and provide other
non-assessment indicators of the system's state to management.
