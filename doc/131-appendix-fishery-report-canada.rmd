# Report of the `r assess_yr - 1` `r sp` fishery in Canada {#sec:app-canada-fishery-report}

**Prepared by the Canadian Advisory Panel and submitted on February 13, 2024
for inclusion in this assessment document.**

The Canadian Offshore Pacific Hake fishery was very poor in 2023. The 2023
year recorded the lowest catch since the fishery began in the late 1970s,
with slightly more than 22,000 tonnes caught, or 21% of the 105,000 tonne
TAC for the fishery. This is down from the 31,000 tonnes caught in 2022
when 29% of the 105,000 tonne TAC was harvested. Generally, the fishermen
found the fishing very poor and similar or worse than 2022. Catches were
inconsistent and usually very scratchy. Most of the fishing occurred around
Father Charles and the Finger Bank and south of there. The fish encountered
were large older fish and small fish were rarely encountered. The bycatch was
primarily Yellowtail rockfish, pollock, and herring. The market for HGT was
also poor.
