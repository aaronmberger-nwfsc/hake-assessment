\section{ASSESSMENT}\label{sec:assessment}

\subsection{Modeling history}\label{sec:assessment-modeling-history}

In spite of the relatively short history of fishing, \fishname\ have surely been
subject to a larger number of stock assessments than any marine species off the
west coast of the U.S.A.~and Canada. These assessments have included a large
variety of age-structured models. Initially, a cohort analysis tuned to fishery
CPUE was used \citep{FrancisSwartzmanEtAl1982}. Later, the cohort analysis was
tuned to National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) triennial acoustic survey estimates of absolute biomass at age
\citep{HollowedAdlersteinEtAl1988}. Since 1989, Stock Synthesis models using
fishery catch-at-age data and acoustic survey estimates of population biomass
and age composition have been the primary assessment method
\citep{JTC2021}.

While the general form of the age-structured assessment has remained similar since 1991,
modeling procedures have been modified in a variety of ways. There have been
alternative data choices, post-data collection processing routines, different
data-weighting schemes, many structural assumptions for the stock
assessment model, alternative MCMC sampling algorithms, and alternative
control rules (Table~\ref{tab:main-assessment-changes}).

Data processing, choices, and weighting have been modified several times in
historical hake assessments. For example, the processing of acoustic data has been
modified over the years through modifications to target-strength calculations
\citep{DornSaunders1997} or the introduction of kriging
\citep{StewartHamel2010}. While survey data have been the key index for
biomass since 1988, surveys that have been used have varied considerably. The
AFSC/NWFSC triennial bottom trawl survey was used from 1988 before being
discarded from the 2009 assessment \citep{HamelStewart2009}. Acoustic
surveys from the years prior to 1995 were used for assessments in the early
1990s, but \citet{StewartForrestEtAl2011} reviewed these early surveys and
deemed that sampling had been insufficient to be comparable with more
recent data. Various recruitment indices have also been considered, but subsequently
rejected \citep{HelserDornEtAl2002, HelserFleischerEtAl2005,
StewartHamel2010}. The process for generating fecundity-at-age from weight-at-age data
changed in 2019 from using time-invariant to year-specific values.
Even where data have been consistently used, the weighting of these data
in the statistical likelihood has changed through the use of various emphasis factors
(e.g., \citealt{Dorn1994, DornSaundersEtAl1999}), a multinomial sample
size on age compositions (e.g., \citealt{DornSaundersEtAl1999, HelserDornEtAl2002,
HelserFleischerEtAl2005, StewartForrestEtAl2011}),
internal estimations of effective sample size using the
Dirichlet-multinomial distribution \citep{JTC2018},
and assumptions regarding year-specific
survey variance. Since 2021, a more efficient Bayesian MCMC sampler
(No-U-Turn Sampler; NUTS; \citealt{HoffmanGelman2014}) was used to estimate posterior distributions
\citep{Monnahan2018, Monnahan2019},
a change from previous assessments that used the random walk Metropolis Hastings
(rwMH) sampler (details described in \citealt{JTC2021}).
The list of changes discussed above is for illustrative
purposes only; it is only a small fraction of the different choices
analysts have made and that reviewers have required.

The structure of the assessment models has perhaps had the largest number of
changes. In terms of spatial models, analysts have considered
spatially explicit forms \citep{Dorn1994, Dorn1997}, spatially implicit forms
\citep{HelserStewartEtAl2006}, and single-area models \citep{JTC2012}. Predicted
recruitment has been modeled by sampling historical recruitment (e.g.,
\citealt{Dorn1994, HelserFleischerEtAl2005}), using a stock-recruitment
relationship parameterized using maximum sustainable yield ($\text{MSY}$) and
the fishing mortality rate estimated to produce the MSY ($\Fmsy$; \citealt{Martell2010}),
and using several alternative steepness priors \citep{JTC2012,
JTC2013}. Selectivity has also been modeled in several ways:
invariant \citep{JTC2012, JTC2013}, time-varying with \citep{HelserDornEtAl2002}
and without \citep{Dorn1994, DornSaunders1997, JTC2012, JTC2013} a random walk,
alternative levels of allowable deviation through time \citep{JTC2013, JTC2017},
age-based \citep{Dorn1994, DornSaunders1997, JTC2012, JTC2013}, and length-based
\citep{HelserMartell2007}.

Several harvest control rules have been explored for providing catch limits from
these stock assessments. \fishname\ stock assessments have presented decision
makers with constant $F$, variable $F$, and the following hybrid control rules:
$F_{\text{SPR}=35\%}$, $\Fforty$, \Ffortyten, $F_{\text{SPR}=45\%}$,
$F_{\text{SPR}=45\%}$--40:10, and $F_{\text{SPR}=50\%}$ (e.g., \citealt{Dorn1996,
JTC2013}). The above is only a small fraction of the number of management
procedures that have actually been investigated. There have been many other
combinations of data, assessment models, and harvest control rules. In addition
to the cases examined in the assessment documents, there have been many more
requested at review panel meetings.

While there have been many changes to \fishname\ modeling procedures, each one
has been considered carefully. Available data have changed over the years, and there
have been many advances in the discipline of fisheries science. In some ways,
the latter has evolved considerably over the course of the fishery for \fishname.
New statistical techniques (e.g., Bayesian vs.~maximum likelihood methods)
and software (e.g., NUTS vs.~random walk Metropolis Hastings samplers) have evolved
and the scientific literature has
suggested potentially important biological dynamics to consider (e.g., movement and
connectivity). Policies requiring the application of
specific control rules have also changed such as the United States' National
Standards Guidelines in 2002 and the \Ffortyten{} harvest control rule
in the Agreement
(see Glossary in Appendix~\ref{chap:glossary}). Analysts making changes to \fishname\ modeling procedures have been
trying to improve the caliber and relevance of the assessments by responding to
new scientific developments, policy requirements, and different or new insights
during the peer review process. Until the process for a MSE
began, initiated in 2013 \citep{JTC2013} and currently being revisited \citep{JacobsenEtAl2021},
none of these modeling procedure changes were evaluated by simulation and
quantitatively compared with performance measures.

\subsection{Description of base model}\label{sec:assessment-base-model}

The \Sexpr{assess.yr} base model has the same population dynamics structure
as the \Sexpr{last.assess.yr} stock assessment.
The statistical-catch-at-age model assumes that the
\fishname\ population is a single coast-wide stock subject to
one aggregated fleet with combined male and female population dynamics.
Stock Synthesis \citep{MethotWetzel2013} version \Sexpr{ss.version} was the modeling platform used.
The largest changes between the
\Sexpr{last.assess.yr} and \Sexpr{assess.yr} stock assessments are the addition of another
year of
acoustic survey and
fishery data and the incorporation of the age-1 index into the base model.

The \Sexpr{assess.yr} base model includes a time series (1995 to
\Sexpr{last.survey.year}) of acoustic age-2$+$ biomass
estimates and acoustic estimates of age-1 fish (see
Section~\ref{sec:data-acoustic-survey} for more details on the age-1 index).
Maturity is assumed to be time-invariant and the
maturity ogive updated in 2018 was retained
(see Section~\ref{sec:data-maturity}).
Fecundity is defined as weight-at-age multiplied by the maturity ogive
and is time-varying across years with empirical weight-at-age data
(\Sexpr{start.yr.age.comps}--\Sexpr{last.data.yr}; see Section~\ref{sec:data-weight-at-age}).
The D-M
likelihood approach \citep{ThorsonEtAl2017Dirichlet} is again used to estimate the weights
associated with age-composition data, rather than iteratively tuning the sample size multiplier
as in 2017 and earlier assessments (see
Section~\ref{sec:data-age-comp-likelihood}). Time-varying fishery
selectivity is retained in the \Sexpr{assess.yr} base model with the magnitude
of the allowable deviations unchanged from the \Sexpr{last.assess.yr} base model
(see Section~\ref{sec:data-variability-selectivity}).
The general parameterization of
selectivity was retained, although additional parameters were required to
estimate an additional year of deviations. The selectivity of the acoustic survey is
assumed to be time invariant. Selectivity curves were modeled as
non-parametric functions estimating age-specific values for each age beginning
at age-2 for the index of age-2$+$ biomass
and age-1 for the fishery until a maximum age of six, after which
all ages are assumed to have the same selectivity.
Selectivity of the age-1 index was fixed at zero for all ages except age one,
which was fixed at the maximum value of one.

Prior probability distributions are used for a select few parameters
and fixed values are used for several parameters. For the base model, the
instantaneous rate of natural mortality ($M$) is estimated with a
\Sexpr{m.prior[1]} prior having a median of \Sexpr{m.prior[2]} and a standard
deviation (in log-space) of 0.1 (see
Section~\ref{sec:data-natural-mortality}). The stock-recruitment function is a
Beverton-Holt parameterization, with the log of the mean unexploited recruitment
(log~$R_0$) freely estimated. This assessment uses the same Beta-distributed prior for
stock-recruit steepness ($h$), based on \citet{MyersBowenEtAl1999}, that has
been applied since 2011 \citep{StewartForrestEtAl2011, JTC2012, JTC2013,
JTC2014, JTC2015, JTC2016, JTC2017, JTC2018, JTC2019, JTC2020, JTC2021}.
Year-specific recruitment deviations were estimated
from \Sexpr{main.recdev.early}--\Sexpr{main.recdev.end+1}
as well as the years \Sexpr{assess.yr}--\Sexpr{assess.yr+3}
for purposes of forecasting. The standard deviation,
$\sigma_r$, of recruitment variability serves as a recruitment deviation
constraint and is fixed at
\Sexpr{base.model$sigma_R_in} in this assessment. This value is based on
consistency with the observed variability in the time series of recruitment
deviation estimates and is the same as assumed in assessments from 2013 to
\Sexpr{last.assess.yr} (Table~\ref{tab:main-assessment-changes}).
Catchability associated with the biomass index ($q_b$) and the age-1 index
($q_1$) were
calculated analytically as per \citet{LudwigWalters1981}
for each sample of posterior parameters, resulting in a distribution of catchability
for each.

Statistical likelihood functions used for data fitting are typical of many stock
assessments. The biomass index was fit via a log-normal
likelihood function, using the observed (and extra 2009) sampling variability,
estimated via kriging, as year-specific weighting. The age-1 index was also specified
as having lognormal error structure. An additional constant and
additive standard deviation on the log-scale component is included for both the
biomass index and the age-1 index, which were
freely estimated to accommodate unaccounted-for sources of process and
observation error.
A D-M likelihood was applied to age-composition data,
with input sample sizes equal to the sum of the number of trips or hauls actually sampled across all
fishing fleets or the number of trawl sets in the research surveys (see Section~\ref{sec:data-age-comp-likelihood}).

Uncertainty of estimated quantities was calculated via MCMC simulations using
NUTS, initiated to achieve a minimum of \Sexpr{f(num.mcmc.samples)}
posterior samples for the base model (and 8,000 samples for all other runs).
Medians (50\% quantiles) are reported together with the
bounds of 95\% credibility intervals calculated as
the 2.5\% quantile and the 97.5\% quantile of posterior distributions from the
MCMC samples, to give equal-tailed intervals. The Stock Synthesis input
files for the base model are given in
Appendices~\ref{chap:data-file}-\ref{chap:weight-at-age-file}.

\subsubsub{Software and Hardware}

The {\tt adnuts} R package \citep{Monnahan2018} was used to apply the NUTS algorithm producing
\Sexpr{f(num.mcmc.samples)} MCMC samples which describe posterior distributions for model
parameters and derived quantities.This is nearly a ten-fold increase in samples from the
2020 assessment \citep{JTC2020} and earlier, and a 33\% increase in samples from last
year's assessment \citep{JTC2021}. The {\tt adnuts} software goes through several steps including
a pilot run which is a short parallel-chain Random Walk Metropolis (RWM) run to ensure the MCMC algorithm is
converging. Once the pilot had been checked for convergence, low effective sample size,
and for slow mixing parameters by comparing pairwise correlation plots, an MLE was run to
obtain the MLE covariance matrix. The covariance matrix was used as the mass matrix for
the main NUTS run. The MLE run was a short run producing 500 samples and with a warmup of
100. The mass matrix was passed to the main NUTS run, and \Sexpr{f(num.mcmc.samples)}
samples from the posterior were generated. The {\tt adapt\_delta} value
sets the target average acceptance probability,
% which reduces
% divergence and forces sampling from a wider part of the posterior,
and was set to 0.95 for
the main NUTS run. The choice of {\tt adapt\_delta} of 0.95 was made based on less divergence
of the posterior and higher effective sample size compared to 0.90, which was used for last
year's assessment. A full explanation of the NUTS algorithm and the {\tt adnuts} package,
including an analysis with the \fishname\ stock
can be found in \citet{Monnahan2019}.

Cloud computing was used for the first time for this assessment through Amazon Web Services' (AWS)
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. Use of these services allowed the JTC to run many models
simultaneously and to acquire more samples from the posterior distribution. The heavy workload
of model runs was moved from local computers to cloud instances leaving local computers
available to continue work on the document and other analyses that were explored. Storage for the model output
was on AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) which can hold "any amount of data" and be accessed only
with dual secret keys.

Calculations and figures from Stock Synthesis output were performed using
\Sexpr{R.Version()$version.string} \citep{R2021} and many R packages (in
particular r4ss, adnuts, and xtable). The use of R, knitr, \LaTeX~and GitHub immensely
facilitated the collaborative writing of this document.
In particular, having most of the code under version control since the 2016
assessment \citep{JTC2016} allows for the completion of a full assessment
in the limited time available. This successful workflow partly motivated a DFO
workshop \citep{EdwardsDupliseaEtAl2018} and an e-book
\citep{CuddingtonEdwardsEtAl2021} to encourage wider uptake of such tools.

\subsection{Response to 2021 Scientific Review Group (SRG) review}\label{sec:assessment-response-review}

The Scientific Review Group (SRG) meeting was held virtually from February
22-25, 2021.

The following are the `SRG Recommendations and Conclusions for the \fishname\
Stock Assessment' from the 2021 SRG report and associated responses from the
JTC:

1. {\bf The SRG notes that $\sigma_R$ is an influential parameter and that
  determining the choice of $\sigma_R$ remains a challenge and encourages the
  JTC to continue to work on the issue.}

\emph{Response -- Developing best practices for modeling equilibrium recruitment ($R_0$)
  and recruitment variability ($\sigma_R$)
  remain broad topics of contemporary research. Recent recommendations suggest that the next
  generation of stock assessment modeling frameworks
  should concomitantly treat recruitment deviations
  as a random effect and estimate $\sigma_R$ \citep{Punt2020}.
  The JTC continues to conduct,
  collaborate on, and monitor ongoing research projects concerning
  approaches for advancing recruitment estimation, as applied to \fishname\ and
  in general. Many of these issues are widespread
  in stock assessment and scientific-based solutions are likely to be the result of medium
  to long-term research projects. We provide an update to our previous response, including specific
  advances in research endeavors.}

\emph{The JTC continues to participate in collaborative research to investigate the concurrent
  estimation of multiple variance parameters within stock assessments.
  For \fishname, this includes the estimation of the variability associated with
  time-varying selectivity ($\Phi$), $\sigma_R$,
  extra standard deviation parameters on index data, and
  Dirichlet-multinomial parameters $\theta_{\text{fish}}$ and $\theta_{\text{surv}}$.
  In this assessment, $\Phi$ and $\sigma_R$ are input as fixed parameters because
  Stock Synthesis uses penalized likelihood, and therefore,
  is not formulated to estimate random effects.
  Additionally, estimation of these variance parameters using MCMC
  requires the specification of hyperpriors for which there has been little research.
  The Laplace approximation \citep{ThorsonHicksEtAl2015} was investigated
  as an alternative means to estimate these parameters.
  However, estimates from this method were large and simulation shows them to
  be biased high.
  Additional research still in its infancy suggests that stock assessment frameworks
  with the ability to estimate random effects internally are
  better at estimating autocorrelated processes than random processes.
  Next steps for the JTC includes fitting Stock Synthesis to these
  same data sets to determine best practices when variance parameters cannot be estimated
  and fitting a wide variety of stock assessment frameworks to data when
  multiple random processes are present in the true dynamics.}

\emph{The Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) framework for \fishname\ creates
  considerable advantages for examining recruitment.
  The stock assessment model in the MSE is written in Template Model Builder (TMB),
  which provides efficient estimation of random effects using the Laplace approximation,
  while being parameterized to mimic the pertinent features of Stock Synthesis used in this assessment.
  Thus, the performance of using restricted maximum likelihood to estimate $\sigma_R$ \citep{Thorson2019}
  can be investigated in terms of management as well as statistical performance.
  The MSE framework can also be used to evaluate the robustness
  of recruitment modeling assumptions and the advantages of including environmentally-driven recruitment indices
  on management performance and uncertainty.  Research slated to be published by Dr. Cathleen Vestfals and
  colleagues at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center that identified specific climate drivers associated with
  \fishname\ early life-history stages and recruitment is now being used to
  select which environment variables to fit as an index of recruitment within the stock assessment model.
  The utility of fitting to a recruitment index will be investigated in terms of
  forecasting skill and management performance within the MSE by the MSE working group.}

\emph{The number of stock assessment frameworks written in TMB or other platforms that allow for
  the estimation of random effects is increasing.
  These frameworks, specifically the
  Woods Hole Assessment Model (WHAM; citealt{StockMiller2021}) and
  State-Space Assessment Model (SAM; \citealt{NielsenBerg2014})
  are both peer reviewed and currently being used for management
  The JTC has fit WHAM to data on \fishname\ and
  explored the estimates of several variance parameters that are currently only
  explored via sensitivity analyses in Stock Synthesis.
  Next steps include fitting data using SAM and
  using estimates from both frameworks as inputs to Stock Synthesis.}

\emph{The JTC is also following work being conducted by the International Council for
  the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) Methods Working Group which, among other things,
  is looking at meta-analytical approaches for estimating recruitment parameters. Results
  from this work could be used to develop informative prior distributions on key
  recruitment parameters.
  Deliverables were put on hold as a result of COVID-19 but
  the project has been making recent progress.}

2. {\bf The SRG recommends exploring alternative methods to simulate recruitment
  in the projections, such as drawing from past observations or using a mixture
  distribution, to characterize a different process than the assumed lognormal
  distribution.}

\emph{Response -- The JTC has begun exploring approaches to make informed decisions about
  current and future recruitment in projections. The inclusion, and associated justification,
  of the age-1 index in the 2022 base model is one example of this (see
  Sections~\ref{sec:data-acoustic-survey} and~\ref{sec:assessment-base-model}).
  Additionally, the JTC has been exploring the fit of oceanographic and environmental
  variables identified by Dr. Cathleen Vestfals as being informative about the
  early life history of \fishname\ as indices of recruitment within Stock Synthesis.
  Originally, these variables were only available for the years 1980--2010.
  Recently, data through 2020 were kindly provided and future research will will focus on
  how to best create a single time series from the two periods.}

\emph{Stock synthesis currently does not have capacity to draw from past observations or use
  mixing distributions to simulate recruitment in the projection period. Available options
  for recruitment during the projection period are the stock-recruitment curve,
  the stock-recruitment curve with a multiplier, and the mean
  across a user-defined time period.  The MSE tool could be used
  to consider alternative recruitment distributional assumptions as future research.}

\emph{Appendix~\ref{chap:rec-plot} presents some new ideas
  for visualising annual recruitment relative to the largest recent recruitment
  to avoid misunderstanding how large some recruitment
  events might be. It also includes figures that further
  enhance understanding of
  the current method for projecting recruitment.}

3. {\bf The SRG requests that the JTC consider developing a decision table in
  the next assessment with recruitment fixed at the median and mean levels to
  assess the resulting impact on stock depletion.}

\emph{Response -- The JTC conducted the standard suite of catch projections using recruitment fixed
  at the median and mean level as calculated across the main recruitment time period (1970--2020).
  Specifying projected recruitment as the median of a given year range is not an option in
  Stock Synthesis.
  Thus, we first calculated the median of median posterior estimates of recruitment
  from the main time period.
  Second, we calculated the ratio between this median value and $R_0$
  to use as a scaling factor on virgin recruitment, which is an option in Stock Synthesis.
  Last, the option for mean recruitment was specified using the mean over the main time period.
  Resulting decision tables are presented in Appendix~****
  **the new tables are not done, not sure if will be done.
  Related to this, the JTC
  also solicited alternative catch levels for use in projections from the JMC and has included those
  in decision tables.}

4. \fishname\ dynamics are highly variable even without fishing
  mortality. {\bf The SRG encourages the JTC (and MSE technical team) to continue
  investigating the usefulness of dynamic reference points in the management of
  \fishname.}

\emph{Response -- There has been no additional work investigating the usefulness of dynamic
  reference points over the past year. Instead, the JTC and MSE technical team have been
  working with Stock Synthesis developers to incorporate dynamic reference point
  capabilities into the stock assessment statistical (Bayesian) and MSE coding
  (full closed-loop simulation) frameworks.
  Posterior distributions associated with dynamic reference points are now possible
  within Stock Synthesis.
  Likewise, the MSE can now utilize dynamic reference points in management procedure
  scenarios. The JTC plans to continue engaging in research related to dynamic reference
  points broadly, as well as specifically for \fishname.}

5. The SRG encourages work to develop a picture of the \fishname\ reproductive
cycle both seasonally and at the life-time scale based on histological and
physiological measurements. In addition, the SRG notes that Canadian samples and
those from the winter research cruises should be included in the maturity
analysis. {\bf The SRG encourages continued sampling and analysis to improve
understanding of the \fishname\ reproductive cycle.}

\emph{Response -- A project was initiated at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center just
  prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic that seeked to refine \fishname\ stock assessment
  assumptions through incorporation of physiological indices of fish reproductive and metabolic status.
  This novel biological information would bolster the current practice of using gonadal histology
  alone for surveyed \fishname\ and provide important data to more accurately determine the reproductive
  cycle of females and the potential spawning stock biomass.
  Data generated so far indicate that two types of lipids, triacylglycerols and phospholipids,
  in the livers of \fishname\ are inversely related and predictive of sexual maturity in females. Levels of
  these lipids are also considerably shifted when aborted/atretic ovarian follicles
  are observed, suggesting that lipid levels may be predictive of skipped spawning, which can reduce
  the effective spawning stock biomass. In 2021, over 20 novel gene expression assays were designed
  for validation in \fishname\ that target factors involved in ovarian development and atresia. Gonadal histology
  and staging was also conducted for fish collected in summer 2018 and 2019, and additional physiological
  samples were collected during the Northwest Fisheries Science Center 2021 Summer Hake Trawl Survey.
  To the extent that onsite laboratory work will be possible in 2022, the goal for the project is to conduct
  liver lipid-class and ovarian RNA analyses for \fishname\ samples collected in 2018 and 2019.
  The addition of these samples will greatly expand the data set and will help determine the utility
  of physiological indicators of reproductive/metabolic status. New developments are expected to inform
  maturity in future \fishname\ stock assessments.}

\emph{\fishname\ ovary samples continue to be collected (see Table~\ref{tab:main-ovaries}) for future
  analyses. While laboratory work has been limited over the past year due to facility closures, plans remain
  to include any available Canadian samples in subsequent maturity analyses.}

6. {\bf The SRG strongly supports the ongoing genetic analyses to determine whether
there are genetic differences between \fishname\ from the area south of Point
Conception and coastal regions to the north.}

\emph{Response -- Genetic work headed by Gary Longo at the Northwest Fisheries Science
  Center using samples from throughout the United States west coast as well
  as British Columbia, including the Strait of Georgia and Puget Sound is ongoing.
  Across two rounds of sequencing, DNA were extracted from 2311 individuals
  across a range of spatial-temporal grid locations from 2015--2019. A total of
  2008 were sequenced based on sufficient DNA concentrations, and 1417 passed quality
  filters. Population genetic analyses generally corroborate the
  single-stock hypothesis with little to no differentiation among the spatial-temporal grids.
  A Principal Component Analysis grouped all Coastal individuals across space and time
  together, while Salish Sea individuals fell out as clearly distinct. Likewise, a Bayesian clustering
  analysis found that the observed genetic variation is best explained by two distinct genetic clusters,
  the Salish Sea and Coastal populations. However, there was some evidence for weak differentiation among
  some spatial-temporal grid locations (across years and location), which may be due to weak differentiation
  among cohorts. This pattern was corroborated with weak, but statistically significant, pairwise FST statistic
  comparisons. Overall, the genetic results corroborate the single-stock hypothesis and highlight the strong
  differentiation between the resident Salish Sea population and the migratory, coastal population
  similar to that found in \citet{GarciaEtAl2018}.}

7. {\bf The SRG also recommends continuing to conduct the following sensitivities:
steepness, natural mortality, $\sigma_R$ , alternative standard deviations for
time-varying selectivity, and down-weighting fishery age-composition data.}

\emph{Response -- The JTC has conducted all of the requested sensitivities (and many
  others) and provides summaries in written (Section~\ref{sec:assessment-sensitivity-analyses}),
  tabular (beginning with Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1}), and
  graphical (beginning with Figure~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-1}) formats in
  this document. Diagnostics of sensitivity models are produced in a separate document
  and are available upon request.}

8. {\bf The SRG encourages the JTC to include a complete reproduction of the
executive summary incorporating the age-1 index in the next assessment and, if
time permits, the retrospective analyses.}

\emph{Response -- The age-1 index is incorporated into the 2022 base model.
  As a result, the JTC has produced a reproduction
  of the Executive Summary tables and figures for the results of
  the sensitivity model that excludes the age-1 index (see Appendix~\ref{chap:age1-survey}).}

9. Based on the preliminary results shown, previous assessments have `correctly'
projected an increase or decrease in recruitment and spawning biomass in
subsequent years, although the projections are usually less definitive than the
current base model results. Given that this analysis provides some confidence in
the current expectations of continued stock decline, {\bf the SRG recommends that the
JTC continue to explore and refine this analysis for future assessments.}

\emph{Response -- The JTC has extended this analysis in
  Figures~\ref{fig:main-historical-1}--\ref{fig:main-historical-retro-bforty-all}
  in response to this
  request, including a retrospective component given that
  all retrospective model runs are performed using MCMC. Analyses are also
  presented for the sensitivity to the base model that removes the age-1 index in
  Figures~\ref{fig:historical-retro-all-age1}
  and~\ref{fig:historical-retro-bforty-all-age1}; all results
  are discussed in
  Section~\ref{sec:assessment-past-projections}.
  Related, the
  JTC is continuing to explore options for improving recruitment estimation and predictions
  (see Responses 1--3, 5, and 8).}

10. The SRG notes that there are currently multiple strong cohorts in the stock
where previously there was only one strong cohort during the period of sample
collection for the ageing error matrix that supports the assessment model. {\bf Based
on this observation, the SRG recommends that an ageing error study using samples
collected during the past decade be conducted in conjunction with the Committee
of Age Reading Experts (CARE).}

\emph{Response -- An ageing error study in conjunction with CARE has commenced, including
  planned sample exchanges between United States and Canada ageing labs. However, a full exchange
  is on hold until there are staff to process the necessary aquatic animal health import permits
  to send age structures to Canada.}

11. {\bf The SRG recommends that historical sources of data be investigated to
determine whether they can be used to supplement the weight-at-age matrix},
including unaged otolith samples (and associated data) from the 1970s that may
be available in the Burke Museum in Seattle.

\emph{Response -- Restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic have limited the availability
  to access historical data. Even if historical \fishname\ age structures were found and were
  determined to be in a usable state, these new structures would need to be integrated into existing
  ageing laboratory work plans.  The JTC has conducted analyses previously showing that small changes to
  historical data have little relevance to current management quantities of interest. So at this time,
  the JTC does not expect small amounts of historical weight-at-age data to significantly alter
  stock assessment results used for management decisions.}

12. {\bf If biological data cannot be collected by any fleet in 2021, the SRG
encourages the JTC to explore model sensitivity to that absence. We commend the
JTC for their foresight in investigating the impact of the lack of 2020 Canadian
freezer-trawler age data in this year's assessment.}

\emph{Response -- In 2021, the JTC explored the absence of 2020 Canadian freezer-
  trawler age data and came to the conclusion that the loss of these data had little
  impact on overall results.  This is, in part, because there were 2020 Canadian
  age data available from the shoreside fleet and the Canadian shoreside and
  freezer-trawler fleets tend to provide similar age-composition information.}

\emph{In 2021, there were almost no biological data available for the Canadian fishery.
  Just a single shoreside trip was sampled, compared to a recent five-year
  average of 55 trips, and no freezer-trawler's provided age data.
  The single sample from the shoreside fishery represents 0.22\% of
  the total number of samples collected in 2021 but because age-composition data are
  scaled by catch to create a single aggregated composition, the sample is
  weighted to represent 5\% of the 2021 age composition.
  Fortunately, in 2021 the catches in the Canadian shoreside fishery were less
  than average, which has been around 15\% over the last two decades,
  or else the single sample would have been given even more weight.
  The consequences of
  this loss of data is a disproportionate (relative to areal catch) reliance on age data
  sampled from U.S. waters as being representative of the coast-wide population for the
  2021 fishing year. Where, age-composition information from U.S. fisheries
  typically includes fewer older fish relative information from the Canadian fisheries.}

\emph{The JTC is  concerned about multi-year changes in sampling and, in particular,
  the ending of complete data series.  As a result, the JTC conducted analyses to evaluate potential
  medium to long-term impacts on the stock assessment with the loss of Canadian age data.
  Starting with the most recent year to 2008,
  we recalculated the age compositions used to fit the model assuming that
  samples were not available from the Canadian freezer-trawler fishery or any
  Canadian fishery (see Table~\ref{tab:main-sampling-history} for sample sizes).
  The base model was refit to these contrived data sets similar to a retrospective analysis
  except only Canadian age data was removed.
  Estimates of recent spawning stock biomass decreased as years of information were removed
  because the data contained less information on older fish than the full data set.}

13. Uncertainty in weight-at-age is not accounted for in the stock assessment
and a five-year average of recent observations is used for all years of the
projections. {\bf The SRG requests that the JTC explore alternative methods for
forecasting weight-at-age and evaluate whether they can improve projections.}

\emph{Response -- It is important to capture key, mechanistic and/or stochastic population processes
  in stock assessment projections to sufficiently characterize levels of prediction uncertainty
  that are consistent with available information to adequately contextualize metrics used to aid
  management decisions. Likewise, it is as important to evaluate the basic population-dynamics
  assumptions used in such projections. Recent, current, and future recruitment are perhaps the most
  influential sources of uncertainty in stock assessment projections. As a result, the JTC has
  prioritized research on recruitment, including supporting analyses and the justification for using
  the age-1 index in the \Sexpr{assess.yr} base model and other related analyses mentioned in this section.}

\emph{Empirical weight-at-age data indicate inter-annual variation in \fishname\ growth, and this variation could
  be related to individual cohort effects (e.g., large cohorts have a negative growth
  influence on
  adjacent cohorts). The JTC is scoping plans to explicitly evaluate these relationships using random effects
  models to partition the variance components (year and cohort) in available weight-at-age data. The JTC also
  plans to explore new weight-at-age forecasting capabilities in Stock Synthesis (once fully tested). A simulation
  experiment that evaluates the influence of variable weight-at-age data relative to other sources of variance in
  stock assessment projections (e.g., recruitment) would also be useful. Until this work is completed, the JTC continues to use
  a recent five-year average in the projection period because it is consistent with recent data
  (Figures~\ref{fig:main-empirical-weight-at-age} and~\ref{fig:main-weight-at-age-lines}).
  This assumption is consistent with what is allowable within other
  commonly used stock assessment frameworks that accommodate
  time-varying dynamics.}

14. {\bf The SRG appreciates the dedication and teamwork displayed by the JTC in
producing the best available scientific information and advice on the Pacific
Hake stock during the COVID-19 pandemic.}

\emph{Response -- Teamwork is an attribute of great interest and pride within the JTC, thank you.}

Also, the final major conclusion of the SRG report was the following:

The SRG considered revisions to the decision tables in the stock assessment that
depict fishing intensity for several catch streams and the associated impacts on
the stock in terms of depletion (spawning biomass relative to $B_0$) for those
catch streams. One main change was implemented: relative spawning biomass was
projected forward for three years from 2021 instead of two years and the
relative biomass values shown in each row now reflect the projected impact of
the specified amount of harvest on stock status at the beginning of the
following year. Additionally, the 25\% and 75\% intervals have been removed from
both tables, leaving the median along with the 5\% and 95\% values from the
distributions that define the 90\% credible intervals. {\bf The SRG believes that the
resulting decision tables are clearer and easier to understand and recommends
that the JMC review these tables along with the standard decision tables, and
provide feedback to the SRG and JTC as to its preference during the March 15-17,
2021 JMC Meeting. These alternative decision tables are presented in Appendix~B
of the JTC Stock Assessment document.}

\emph{Response -- Over the past year, the JTC engaged in discussions with the JMC about decision
  table formatting and alternative projection catch streams. As a result, the JTC will be using the
  the new format in the 2022 stock assessment, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:assessment-model-projections}.}

\subsection{Modeling results}\label{sec:assessment-modeling-results}

\subsubsection{Changes from \Sexpr{last.assess.yr} }\label{sec:assessment-changes}

A set of `bridging' models was constructed to evaluate the component-specific
effects of all changes from the \Sexpr{last.assess.yr} base model to
the \Sexpr{assess.yr} base model.

In short, these included the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Update to the latest version of Stock Synthesis, version \Sexpr{ss.version};
  \item Update catch and age-composition data from years prior to \Sexpr{last.data.yr};
  \item Add new catch and age-composition data for \Sexpr{last.data.yr};
  \item Update acoustic survey biomass and age-composition data from years prior to \Sexpr{last.data.yr};
  \item Add the \Sexpr{last.data.yr} acoustic survey biomass and age-composition estimates;
  \item Add weight-at-age data for \Sexpr{last.data.yr} as well as update data for years prior; and
  \item Add the age-1 index time series.
  %\item Add \Sexpr{last.data.yr} survey biomass estimate;
  %\item Add \Sexpr{last.data.yr} survey age-composition data; and
\end{itemize}

The bridging steps can be grouped into three main sets of changes,
with the majority of the steps being those that are performed routinely.
The first step updated the Stock Synthesis framework to follow current best practices.
The second step updated all information available from the fishery and acoustic survey.
The third step implemented changes related to the addition of the age-1 index.

Stock Synthesis version \Sexpr{ss.version} includes
a number of changes since the version used by \citet{JTC2021},
mostly related to options not explicitly used in this assessment.
%Changes relevant to the assessment of \fishname\ include changes to
%increase the convergence of estimates of catchability and parameter deviations,
%performance of jitter runs when parameters are near boundary conditions, and
%stability of the transition to MCMC when the parameters specifying
%bias adjustment of the recruitment deviations are turned off.
Adaptations within the stock synthesis modeling framework itself had no effect
on parameter estimates compared to the \Sexpr{last.assess.yr}
base model and thus no effect on resulting time series.
%(Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel-1}).

The second set of bridging steps was conducted to update fishery-dependent
and fishery-independent data.
This primarily included minor adjustments in catch, fishery age-composition,
the 2019 acoustic survey biomass estimate, and
weight-at-age values as databases are continually updated.
Samples that were recently aged but not available for the \Sexpr{last.assess.yr}
assessment were included.
These changes to pre-\Sexpr{last.assess.yr} data were small enough that they had
little impact on the model results (Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel-1}).

The addition of \Sexpr{last.data.yr} catch and fishery age compositions allowed the model to be
extended to the start of \Sexpr{assess.yr}, but the estimates for
\Sexpr{assess.yr} remained highly uncertain
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel-1})
in the absence of additional information about recent recruitment.
These data had relatively little impact on the historical biomass estimates,
indicating that the observed \Sexpr{last.data.yr} ages were consistent with the model
estimates without those data (Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel-1}). However,
the addition of these data did slightly shift recent recruitment
estimates, though overall uncertainty was still high. Recruitment estimates and stock
trajectory were relatively unchanged with the addition of \Sexpr{last.data.yr}
weight-at-age data.
This bridging step also shifted the ending year of the deviations
in the selectivity parameters from \Sexpr{last.data.yr-1} to
\Sexpr{last.data.yr} because of the addition of fishery data in \Sexpr{last.data.yr}.

Including the \Sexpr{last.data.yr} fishery-independent biomass estimate and
age compositions led to a slightly more optimistic
trajectory of the stock over the last couple of years
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel-1}),
whereas updating the 2019 survey biomass estimate itself had negligible
effect. The addition of \Sexpr{last.data.yr} survey data led to small shifts
in expected recruitment, particularly for the 2016, 2017, and 2018 year classes.
The 2018 year class is estimated to be higher in this
assessment than in the \Sexpr{last.assess.yr} assessment, but it still remains
a below-average year class.
This increase is largely driven by the addition
of the 2021 acoustic-survey age compositions, because this
%where the proportion of age-9 fish and age-5 fish were higher than what
%the \Sexpr{end.yr-1} assessment model would have otherwise predicted
%given mortality.
was the first time
the 2018 and 2019 cohorts were adequately sampled (age-2 or older) by the survey,
which is why the uncertainty associated with these cohorts was reduced (though
still quite uncertain; Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel-1}).

The final bridging step added the age-1 index time series (1995 to
\Sexpr{last.survey.year}) as an additional source of information to inform recent
recruitment. The age-1 index has been evaluated in many previous stock
assessments as a sensitivity analysis, and in recent years a close examination
of the full suite of assessment results (mimicking the structure of executive summary)
were produced in appendices to examine this key sensitivity model run. The age-1 index is fit
in the assessment model through a lognormal contribution to the likelihood function.
Section~\ref{sec:data-acoustic-survey} provides further description and justification
for using the age-1 index in the base model. The addition of this data source resulted
in a slight increase in recent recruitment, most noticeably for the 2018 and 2020 year
classes (Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel-2}). In turn, this results in a slightly higher
trajectory of spawning stock biomass from 2013--2022 and a change in 2022
median relative spawning stock biomass from
\Sexpr{round(median(bridge.models.2[[1]]$mcmc$Bratio_2022),3)*100}\%. to
\Sexpr{round(median(base.model$mcmc$Bratio_2022),3)*100}\%.

\subsubsection{Assessment model results}\label{sec:assessment-model-results}

\subsubsub{Model Fit}

Stationarity of the posterior distribution for model parameters was
re-assessed via a suite of standard single-chain and multi-chain diagnostic tests
via graphical summaries and interactive web applications ({\tt ShinySTAN};
\href{https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/shinystan}{https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/shinystan}).
Key diagnostic figures are given in Appendix~\ref{chap:mcmc-diagnostics} and now
discussed.
All estimated parameters showed good mixing
during sampling, no evidence for lack of convergence, and acceptable autocorrelation
(results for some key parameters are shown in
Figures~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-diag-m-r0}--\ref{fig:main-mcmc-diag-dm}).
Correlation-corrected effective sample
sizes were sufficient to summarize the posterior distributions and neither the
Geweke nor the Heidelberger and Welch statistics for these parameters exceeded
critical values more frequently than expected via random chance
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-diag-hists}).
The Gelman-Rubin multi-chain diagnostic test,
which compares within-chain variance to among-chain variance, further indicated that
convergence was adequately achieved (examined via {\tt ShinySTAN}).
Correlations among key parameters were
generally low, with the exception of $M$ and $\log R_0$ (Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-pairs}).
Estimates of recruitment in 2010 and 2014 were correlated with
the derived quantity of catch from the default harvest rule in \Sexpr{end.yr},
as to be expected given the dependencies
among these quantities (Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-pairs}). An examination of
deviations in recruitment (log-scale differences between estimated and expected
recruitment values) from recent years
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-pairs-recruit-devs}) indicates the highest
correlation
(\Sexpr{round(cor(base.model$mcmc$Main_RecrDev_2014,base.model$mcmc$Main_RecrDev_2016),2)})
was between the 2014 and 2016 recruitment deviations. This continues to be likely
caused by the relative proportion of these two cohorts being better informed by
recent age-composition data.

The estimate (median and 95\% credible interval) for $\log \theta_{\text{fish}}$ is
\Sexpr{log.theta.fishery.median}
(\Sexpr{log.theta.fishery.025},
\Sexpr{log.theta.fishery.975}),
giving an effective sample
size multiplier $\theta_{\text{fish}} / (1 + \theta_{\text{fish}})$
of
\Sexpr{DM.weight.fishery.median}
(\Sexpr{DM.weight.fishery.025},
\Sexpr{DM.weight.fishery.975}).
The survey age-composition parameter is also well-sampled
with
\protect{$\log \theta_{\text{surv}}$} estimated as
\Sexpr{log.theta.survey.median}
(\Sexpr{log.theta.survey.025},
\Sexpr{log.theta.survey.975}),
and the resulting effective sample
size multiplier $\theta_{\text{surv}} / (1 + \theta_{\text{surv}})$
of
\Sexpr{DM.weight.survey.median}
(\Sexpr{DM.weight.survey.025},
\Sexpr{DM.weight.survey.975}).

The base model fit to the
acoustic survey biomass index (Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-survey-fit})
remains similar to the \Sexpr{last.assess.yr} base model.
The \Sexpr{survey.end.yr} survey biomass estimate resulted in a slight upward shift
in the fit to the \Sexpr{penult.survey.year}
survey data points, but the result of a relatively stable biomass trend from 2013--2019
is the same (Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-survey-fit}).
The addition of \Sexpr{last.assess.yr} fishery data
was the main reason for this change in fit to the 2019 data point (Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel-1}).
The \Sexpr{last.assess.yr} survey estimate was lower than in 2019 (second lowest since 2013),
and the model fit indicates a decline in biomass compared to the relatively stable 2013--2019 period.
The 2001 survey biomass index continues to be well below any model predictions that were evaluated,
and no direct cause for this is known.  The survey did begin earlier that year than all other surveys
between 1995 and 2009 (Table~\ref{tab:main-survey-history}), which may explain
some portion of the anomaly, along with El Ni\~no conditions and age structure.
The underestimation of the 2009 biomass estimate is larger than
the underestimation of any other year.
The uncertainty of this point (both modeled and actual) is high
because of the presence of large numbers of Humboldt Squid during the
survey. Humboldt Squid have similar target strength to hake
which could introduce bias in the biomass estimate for that year, and
which also likely influenced hake population dynamics through predation in that year.

The median posterior density estimates underfit the 2015 survey
index, overfit the 2017 and 2019 indices, and closely fit the 2021 index (Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-survey-fit}).
This is likely due to slight differences in what the fishery composition data
and survey composition data, when considered independently, would otherwise
suggest as population trends.
Additionally, the population has undergone recent high catch levels and produced
a couple of above-average cohorts that are now mature.
%resulting in a population
%trend that has been relatively stable from 2013 to \Sexpr{survey.end.yr}.

The base model fit to the index of age-1 fish highlights some over- and
under-estimation but an overall general confirmation of relative year class strength
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-age1-fit}). In particular, age-1 fish in 2009 and 2015
(the 2008 and 2014 cohorts) were underestimated relative to the index, while the
age-1 fish in 1995 and 2017 (1994 and 2016 cohorts) were overestimated.
The age-1 fish in 2011 (the large 2010 cohort) was closely fit.  Age-1 fish in 2021 (2020 cohort)
were slightly underestimated and, being so young, had the largest amount of uncertainty in the time
series. The model indicates that the 2020 cohort may be similar in
size to the 2016 cohort, based on information in the age-1 index and from age-1 fish
caught in the fishery.

Fits to the age-composition data continue to show close correspondence to the
dominant and small cohorts observed in the data
when the data give a consistent signal
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-age-comp-fits}). Because of the time-varying fishery
selectivity, the fit to commercial age-composition data is particularly good,
although models with time-invariant selectivity used in previous years also fit
the age compositions well.
In the \Sexpr{last.data.yr} fishery, \Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, last.data.yr, 3, cap = FALSE)}.
Age compositions from the \Sexpr{survey.end.yr} acoustic survey suggest a similar age
structure, i.e., \Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, survey.end.yr, 3, cap = FALSE, fleet = 2)}.
Combined, the 2015--\Sexpr{last.data.yr} fishery age-composition data and the
2017--\Sexpr{survey.end.yr} acoustic survey age-composition data
suggest that 2014 was a strong recruitment
year, and the model was able to adequately
fit to these observations (Figure~\ref{fig:main-age-comp-fits}).
The 2016 cohort, which has been observed twice by the survey,
%\Sexpr{ceiling((survey.end.yr-2016)/2)} times
still appears to be smaller than
the 2014 cohort.
The \Sexpr{survey.end.yr} survey was the first to sample the
\Sexpr{survey.end.yr-2} cohort, confirming that
it
was not extremely large (\Sexpr{survey.a2.prop}\% of the \Sexpr{survey.end.yr} survey catch).
Residual
patterns to the fishery and survey age data do not show patterns that would
indicate systematic bias in model predictions
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-age-comp-pearson}).

The median estimates for numbers, biomass,
exploitation rate, and catch (in numbers and in biomass) for each age class in
each year are given in
Tables~\ref{tab:main-est-numbers-at-age}-\ref{tab:main-est-catch-at-age-biomass}.
For the major cohorts, the resulting estimated age-specific catch, natural mortality, and
surviving biomasses are given in Table~\ref{tab:main-cohort-effects}.
For example, the catch weight of the 2014 cohort at age-5 was slightly less
than that of the 2010 cohort at age-5 and the resulting surviving biomass of
the 2014 cohort was approximately half of the surviving biomass of the 2010
cohort.

Posterior distributions for both steepness and natural mortality are strongly
influenced by priors (Figure~\ref{fig:main-prior-posterior}). The posterior for
steepness is only slightly updated by the data, as expected given the low
sensitivity to steepness values found in previous hake assessments. The natural
mortality parameter, on the other hand, is shifted to the right of the prior
distribution and the prior may be constraining the posterior distribution from shifting
further. Broadening
the prior distribution by increasing the prior standard deviation for the natural mortality
parameter is examined in sensitivity runs (see Section~\ref{sec:assessment-sensitivity-analyses}).
Other parameters showed updating from diffuse priors to posterior
distributions, including $\theta_{\text{fish}}$ and  $\theta_{\text{surv}}$ (as outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:data-age-comp-likelihood}).

The \Sexpr{assess.yr} base model specified the same level of variation (standard
deviation of $\Phi = 1.4$) associated with time-varying fishery selectivity as
the \Sexpr{last.assess.yr} base model, effectively
allowing the model flexibility (i.e., a lower penalty on the overall
likelihood) to fit to data that suggests high variability among years for each
age. This level
of variation led to results that were consistent with the \Sexpr{survey.end.yr} acoustic survey
biomass estimate and gave reasonable fits to the fishery age-composition data,
given that there is considerable uncertainty associated with
spatial changes in fish availability (due to movement) and recent
variability in oceanographic conditions. Estimated selectivity deviations for
age-3 and age-4 fish are larger from
2010 to 2012 than in recent years until 2020 when the deviation for age-4 was large again (Figures~\ref{fig:main-tv-selex}
and~\ref{fig:main-tv-selex-uncertainty}). The median selectivity peaks at age 4
in 2010, 2012 and 2020 and at age 3 in 2011 suggesting targeting (or generally higher
availability) of the younger cohorts
in those years. This pattern is consistent with the 2008 cohort appearing strong
in the fishery age compositions initially, but decreasing in prominence
from 2013 onward (Figure~\ref{fig:main-age-comp-fits}).
Fishery selectivity on age-2 fish was at its highest
in 2016, followed by 2018.
Fishery selectivity for the most recent year was characteristic of a logistic
pattern, where selectivity increase smoothly from age-2
to a peak at age-5 and older ages
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-tv-selex-uncertainty}). Even though the
survey selectivity is time invariant, the
posterior shows a broad band of uncertainty between ages 2 and 5
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-tv-selex-uncertainty-lines}). The decline in
survey selectivity between ages 3 and 4 may be an artifact of the interaction
between large cohorts and the biennial timing of recent surveys, with the
2010, 2014, and 2016 cohorts occurring in the survey at ages 3 and 5 but not age 4.
Fishery selectivity is
likewise very uncertain (Figures~\ref{fig:main-tv-selex-uncertainty}
and~\ref{fig:main-tv-selex-uncertainty-lines}), but in spite of this
uncertainty, changes in year-to-year patterns in the estimates are still
evident, particularly for age-3 and age-4 fish, though these patterns might also
reflect time-varying mortality processes.

\subsubsub{Stock biomass}

The base stock assessment model indicates that, since the 1960s, \fishname\
female spawning biomass has ranged from well below to above unfished
equilibrium (Figures~\ref{fig:main-female-spawning-biomass}
and~\ref{fig:main-relative-spawning-biomass} and
Tables~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior} and \ref{tab:main-ci-posterior}). The
model estimates that it was below the unfished equilibrium in the 1960s,
at the start of the assessment period, due to lower than average recruitment.
The stock is estimated to have increased rapidly and was above unfished equilibrium
in the mid-1970s and mid-1980s (after two large recruitments in the early 1980s).
It then declined steadily to a low in 1999. This
was followed by a brief increase to a peak in 2002 as the
very large 1999 year class matured. The 1999 year class largely supported the fishery
for several years due to relatively small recruitments between 2000 and
2007. With the aging 1999 year class, median female spawning biomass declined
throughout the late 2000s, reaching a time-series low of
\Sexpr{median.bio.min}~million~t in \Sexpr{median.bio.min.year}. The assessment
model estimates that median spawning biomass then peaked again in 2013 and 2014 due
to a very large 2010 year class and an
above-average 2008 year class. The subsequent decline from 2014 to 2016 is primarily
from the 2010 year class surpassing the age at which gains in weight from growth
are greater than the loss in weight from mortality (growth-mortality transition).
The 2014 year class is estimated to be large, though not as large as the 1999
and 2010 year classes, resulting in an increased biomass in 2017. The estimated
biomass was relatively steady from 2017 to 2019, and then declined in 2020
and 2021 due to the 2014 and 2016 year classes moving through the growth-mortality
transition during a period of high catches.

The median estimate of the \Sexpr{end.yr} relative spawning biomass (spawning
biomass at the start of \Sexpr{end.yr} divided by that at unfished equilibrium,
$B_0$) is \Sexpr{curr.depl.median}\%. However, the uncertainty
is large, with a 95\%
posterior credibility interval from \Sexpr{curr.depl.lower}\% to
\Sexpr{curr.depl.upper}\% (Tables~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior} and
\ref{tab:main-ci-posterior}).

The median estimate of
the \Sexpr{end.yr} spawning biomass is \Sexpr{curr.bio.median}~million~t (with a
95\% posterior credibility interval from \Sexpr{curr.bio.lower} to
\Sexpr{curr.bio.upper}~million~t). The estimate of the \Sexpr{end.yr-1} female
spawning biomass is \Sexpr{prev.bio.median}
(\Sexpr{prev.bio.lower}--\Sexpr{prev.bio.upper})~million~t. This is a somewhat higher
median and broader credibility interval than the \Sexpr{prev.bio.median.last.assess}
(\Sexpr{prev.bio.lower.last.assess}--\Sexpr{prev.bio.upper.last.assess})~million~t estimated
in the \Sexpr{end.yr-1} assessment, but there is considerable overlap of the credibility
intervals.
The increase appears to be due to the addition of survey data, namely the 2021
biomass index and age compositions, plus the full age-1 index (as outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:assessment-changes}).   % copied to Exec Summary also.
%%The additional
%%data in the 2018 assessment has reduced the uncertainty of the 2017 biomass, and
%%decreased the median partly due to the impact of the survey biomass estimate.

\subsubsub{Recruitment}

The new data available and addition of the age-1 index for this assessment do not
significantly change the pattern of recruitment estimated in recent assessments.
However, estimates of absolute recruitment for some recent years have increased.
For example, this assessment's median estimate of the 2014 recruitment is
% putting in - signs when it's a decrease, and saying 'lower'. So check
%  carefully in 2022 (could put in an automatic switch for the text)
\Sexpr{f(((recruitment.med.to.compare - prev.assess.recruitment.med)["2014"]), 1)}~billion
fish higher than in last year's assessment
(a \Sexpr{f(((((recruitment.med.to.compare - prev.assess.recruitment.med)["2014"]) /
(prev.assess.recruitment.med)["2014"]) * 100), 0)}\% increase).
Similarly, estimates for the large 2016 and small 2018 recruitments have increased by
\Sexpr{f(((((recruitment.med.to.compare - prev.assess.recruitment.med)["2016"]) /
(prev.assess.recruitment.med)["2016"]) * 100), 0)}\%
(\Sexpr{f((recruitment.med.to.compare - prev.assess.recruitment.med)["2016"], 1)}~billion fish) and
\Sexpr{f(((((recruitment.med.to.compare - prev.assess.recruitment.med)["2018"]) /
(prev.assess.recruitment.med)["2018"]) * 100), 0)}\%
(\Sexpr{f(((recruitment.med.to.compare - prev.assess.recruitment.med)["2018"]), 1)}~billion fish),
respectively, but the general notion remains that the 2016 cohort is above average
and the 2018 cohort is below average.

\fishname\ appear to have low average recruitment with occasional large year-classes
(Figures~\ref{fig:main-recruitment} and \ref{fig:main-recruitment-devs},
Tables~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior} and \ref{tab:main-ci-posterior}).
Very large year classes in 1980, 1984, and 1999 supported much of the commercial
catch from the 1980s to the mid-2000s. From 2000 to 2007, estimated recruitment
was at some of the lowest values in the time series, but this was followed by an above average
2008 year class. Current estimates continue to indicate a very strong
2010 year class comprising \Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2014, spec.yr=2010)}\% of the coast-wide
commercial catch in 2014,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2016, spec.yr=2010)}\% of the 2016 catch,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2018, spec.yr=2010)}\% of the 2018 catch (all
unchanged from last year's assessment), and
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2020, spec.yr=2010)}\% of the 2020 catch.
The decline from 2014 to 2016
was due to the large influx of the 2014
year class (\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2016, spec.yr=2014)}\% of the 2016 catch was age-2 fish from the
2014 year class; this was larger than the proportion of age-2 fish,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2012, spec.yr=2010)}\%, from the 2010 year
class in 2012). The median estimate of the 2010 year class is
very slightly below the highest ever (for 1980), with a \Sexpr{prob.percent.2010.rec.gt.1980.rec}\%
probability that the 2010 year class is larger than the 1980 year class (this
probability was \Sexpr{prob.percent.2010.rec.gt.1980.rec.last.year.assess}\% for
last year's assessment).

The current assessment also estimates a strong 2014 year class
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-numbers-at-age}) comprising
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2016, spec.yr=2014)}\% of the 2016 catch,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2017, spec.yr=2014)}\% of the 2017 catch,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2018, spec.yr=2014)}\% of the 2018 catch,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2019, spec.yr=2014)}\% of the 2019 catch,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2020, spec.yr=2014)}\% of the 2020 catch, and
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2021, spec.yr=2014)}\% of the 2021 catch.
The 2016 cohort also appears to be above average at
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2018, spec.yr=2016)}\% of the 2018 catch,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2019, spec.yr=2016)}\% of the 2019 catch,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2020, spec.yr=2016)}\% of the 2020 catch, and
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2021, spec.yr=2016)}\% of the 2021 catch.
Although the absolute size of the 2014 year
class remains uncertain, at least more so than
cohorts that have been observed for more years, seven years of fishery data and four years of survey data
suggest that it is a strong year class.  The 2016 year class is
estimated to be above average (similar in size to the 2008 year class) from five years
of fishery data and three years of survey data. The 2017 year class was first observed by the survey in 2019 and
is estimated to be about average in size. With the addition of the age-1 index, there
is information beyond just fishery encounters in
the data to estimate the size of the \Sexpr{end.yr-2} year class. Collectively, these data
indicate that the \Sexpr{end.yr-2} year class is above average, while the 2019 year class is
informed by the \Sexpr{last.survey.year} biomass index and fishery data, but has no age-1 index.

%The additional data in the 2020 assessment has decreased the median estimate of the
%2014 year class to
%\Sexpr{recruitment.med.in.2014}~billion fish (Table~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior}),
%from the \Sexpr{last.assess.recruitment.med.in.2014}~billion estimated in the 2020 assessment (Table~25 of \citealt{JTC2020}).
%The 2014 year class remains the fifth largest estimated recruitment, albeit
%with large uncertainty (Table~\ref{tab:main-ci-posterior} and
%Figure~\ref{fig:main-recruitment}).  The median estimate for the 2016 year class
%is \Sexpr{recruitment.med.in.2016}~billion fish
%(\Sexpr{recruitment.lower.in.2016}--\Sexpr{recruitment.upper.in.2016}~billion fish; Tables~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior} and
%\ref{tab:main-ci-posterior}).

The model currently estimates small 2011, 2013, 2015, 2018
and 2019 year classes (median recruitment well below the mean of all median recruitments) and near
average 2012 and 2017 year class.  The proportion of the catch that was age-1 fish
in 2019 (2018 year class) and 2020 (2019 year class) was well below that observed in 2018
(2017 year class) and 2017 (2016 year class; Table~\ref{tab:main-all-age-data-fishery}).
% See exec-summary text, and look at this also:
%  years.since.2010.recruitment.med.below.mean
There is no information in the data to estimate the sizes of the
\Sexpr{end.yr-1} and \Sexpr{end.yr} year classes. Retrospective analyses of year
class strength for young fish have shown the estimates of recent recruitment to
be unreliable prior to at least model age-3 (observed at age-2) without a survey in the
most recent year and age-2 (observed at age-1) with a survey.

The estimated recruitments with uncertainty for each year and the
overall stock recruit relationship are provided in
Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-sr-variability}. Extremely large variability about the
expectation and about the joint uncertainty of individual recruitment and
spawning biomass pairs are evident. High and low recruitments have
been produced throughout the range of observed spawning biomass
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-sr-variability}). The standard deviation of the time
series of median recruitment deviation estimates for the years 1970-\Sexpr{last.data.yr - 1}, which
are informed by the age compositions and the age-1 index, is
\Sexpr{sd.med.recr.dev.estimates}. This value is higher than,
but consistent with, the base model value of \Sexpr{base.model$sigma_R_in}.  % $

\subsubsub{Exploitation status}

The median estimated relative fishing intensity on the stock is below
the SPR$_{40\%}$ target for all years
% sort(median.intensity)    % 2017 assessment 1999 was slightly over
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-fishing-intensity} and
Tables~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior} and \ref{tab:main-ci-posterior}).
It was close
to the target in 2008, 2010 and 2011, but harvest in those years did not exceed
the catch limits that were specified, based on the best available science and
harvest control rules in place at the time.
% Also close in 1999 but no TAC then according to landings.vs.tac[34,], so
%  don't mention 1999.
Exploitation fraction (catch divided
by biomass of fish of age-2 and above) has shown relatively similar patterns
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-exploitation-fraction} and
Tables~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior} and
\ref{tab:main-ci-posterior}). Although displaying similar patterns, the exploitation
fraction does not necessarily correspond to fishing intensity because fishing
intensity more directly accounts for the age-structure of both the population and
the catch.
Median relative fishing intensity is estimated to have declined from
\Sexpr{median.intensity.2010}\% in 2010 to \Sexpr{median.intensity.2015}\%
in 2015, and then it leveled off around 70\% from 2016 to 2019 before dropping to
\Sexpr{median.intensity.2020}\% in 2020 and
\Sexpr{median.intensity.2021}\% in 2021.
The median exploitation fraction has increased from a recent low of
\Sexpr{exploitation.med.2012} in 2012 to \Sexpr{exploitation.med.2017} in 2017 and has
remained relatively stable since then (dropping no further than
\Sexpr{exploitation.med.2018}).
Although there is a considerable amount of imprecision
around these recent estimates due to uncertainty in recruitment and spawning
biomass, the 95\% posterior credibility interval of relative fishing intensity
was below the SPR management target from 2012 through 2016 and again from 2018
to 2021 (Figure~\ref{fig:main-fishing-intensity}). The median estimate
for 2017 is below the management target, however the 95\% posterior
credibility interval does include the target level.

% Note that exploitation.med.penult.yr comes out as 0.06, but in Table d
%  is 0.065, because the true value is 0.0648.... The text rounds to two decimal
%  places but Table rounds to three, but rounding is done correctly because of
%  the automation; i.e. we haven't incorrectly rounded up to 0.07, which we
%  could happen from looking at Table d (if the true value wasn't checked). Nice.

\subsubsub{Management performance}

Over the last decade (\Sexpr{end.yr-10}--\Sexpr{end.yr-1}), the mean coast-wide
utilization rate (i.e., proportion of catch target removed) has been
\Sexpr{tot.last.10.years.attainment}\% and catches have been below
coast-wide targets (Table~\ref{tab:main-landings-tac}). From \Sexpr{end.yr-5} to
\Sexpr{end.yr-1}, the mean utilization rates differed between the United States
(\Sexpr{usa.last.5.years.attainment}\%) and Canada
(\Sexpr{can.last.5.years.attainment}\%). However, country-specific
quotas (or catch targets) in 2020 and 2021 were specified unilaterally, due to the lack of
an agreement on a coast-wide 2020 and 2021 TAC.  In 2015, the utilization rate for the
coast-wide fishery was the lowest of the previous decade
(\Sexpr{tot.2015.attainment}\%) due, in part, to difficulties locating
aggregations of fish and possibly economic reasons.
% Manual done 2020 - check above sentence with
%  landings.vs.tac[landings.vs.tac$Year %in% (end.yr-10):(end.yr-1),10].
Before 2015,
the underutilization in the United States was mostly a result of unrealized
catch in the tribal apportionment, while reports from stakeholders in Canada
suggested that hake were less aggregated in Canada and availability had
declined. In 2016, the utilization rate increased but remained below pre-2015
levels, despite the total 2016 catch being one of the highest of the preceding years.
This is in large part due to increasing catch targets as biomass continues to
increase. The total utilization rate in recent years (2017--2021) has been relatively steady
and close to the average over the last decade (\Sexpr{tot.last.year.attainment}\%).
%During the last two years, utilization rates have been stable
%in both the United States (\Sexpr{usa.last.2.years.attainment}\%) and Canada
%(about \Sexpr{can.last.2.years.attainment}\%).
Total landings last exceeded the coast-wide quota in 2002 when utilization was 112\%.
% Manual done 2020, including checking penultimate sentence numbers with table.

The median relative fishing intensity was below target in all years throughout the time series
%the 1999 year used to be just above 1 but now estimated to be just below 1
% \Sexpr{median.intensity.above.one.years[-length(median.intensity.above.one.years)]} and

(Table~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior} and
Figures~\ref{fig:main-fishing-intensity} and~\ref{fig:main-phase}).
The median relative spawning biomass was
above the $\Bforty$ reference point in all years except 2007, 2009, and 2010
(Table~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior} and Figure~\ref{fig:main-relative-spawning-biomass}).
% 2017 assessment: all years except 1968, 1998-2000 and 2007-2011

% Andy summarising those years manually, based on:
% median.relative.bio.below.target
% Manual done 2020. Interesting that years are becoming fewer.
These are also shown on a phase plot of the joint history of relative spawning biomass
and relative fishing intensity
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-phase}).
%Between 2007 and 2011, however, median relative
%fishing intensity ranged from \Sexpr{median.intensity.2007.to.2011.min}\% to
%\Sexpr{median.intensity.2007.to.2011.max}\% and
%median relative spawning biomass
%between \Sexpr{median.relative.bio.2007.to.2011.min} and
%\Sexpr{median.relative.bio.2007.to.2011.max}.
Relative spawning biomass increased from the lows in 2007--2010 with above average
recruitment in 2008, 2010, 2014, and 2016. Correspondingly, relative fishing
intensity has remained well below target despite recent increases in total catch.
% Relative spawning biomass has been
% above the target since \Sexpr{median.relative.bio.above.target.since}.
While
there is large uncertainty in the \Sexpr{end.yr-1} estimates of relative fishing
intensity and relative spawning biomass, the model estimates a \Sexpr{joint.percent.prob.above.below}\%
joint probability of being both above the target relative fishing intensity in
\Sexpr{end.yr-1} and below the $\Bforty$ relative spawning biomass level at the
start of \Sexpr{end.yr}.

\subsection{Model uncertainty}\label{sec:assessment-model-uncertainty}
 % Manual 2020 done
The base assessment model integrates over the substantial uncertainty associated
with several important model parameters including: biomass index and age-1 index catchabilities
($q_b$ and $q_1$, respectively), the magnitude of the stock (via the $\log R_0$ parameter for equilibrium
recruitment), productivity of the stock (via the steepness parameter, $h$, of
the stock-recruitment relationship), the rate of natural mortality ($M$), annual
selectivity for key ages, recruitment deviations, and survey and fishery data
weights (via the Dirichlet-multinomial parameters
$\theta_{\text{fish}}$ and $\theta_{\text{surv}}$).
The uncertainty portrayed
by the posterior distribution is a better representation of uncertainty than
asymptotic approximations about MLEs because it allows for asymmetry (Figure~\ref{fig:main-prior-posterior};
also see \citealt{JTC2012} for further discussion and
examples).
%this is the first \fishname\ assessment to almost exclusively use
%posterior distributions instead of MLEs.
%Note that we use the term MLE even though the priors are involved in the likelihood
%calculation and so the more accurate term would be the mode of the posterior density.

The medians of the key parameters from the posterior distribution are similar to
those in last year's base model (Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates}). The largest
change was a 12\% increase in unfished recruitment ($R_0$).
Medians of some of the derived quantities also change somewhat; in particular,
recruitment in 2010, 2014, and 2016 increased,
and $B_0$ has increased from that estimated in the \Sexpr{assess.yr - 1} assessment.

The \fishname\ stock displays a very high degree of recruitment variability,
perhaps the largest of any west coast groundfish stock, resulting in large and
rapid biomass changes. This volatility, coupled with a dynamic fishery that
potentially targets strong cohorts (resulting in time-varying selectivity)
will in most circumstances continue to result in highly uncertain
estimates of current stock status and even less-certain projections of the stock
trajectory. The addition of the age-1 index in this assessment will, in some cases, help
to reduce this uncertainty.  However, further work is needed to improve upon the
characterization of uncertainty in the age-1 index itself, which is based on a
time invariant assumption about index observation error and catchability.

Uncertainty measures in the base model underestimate the total uncertainty in
the current stock status and projections, because they do not account for
alternative structural models for hake population dynamics and fishery processes
(e.g., recruitment, selectivity, or spatial fleet or population structure), the
effects of alternative data-weighting choices, survey catchability, and the scientific basis for prior
probability distributions. To address structural uncertainties, the JTC investigated
a range of alternative models, and we present the key sensitivity analyses along with
a suite of other informative sensitivity analyses using full MCMC results
(Section~\ref{sec:assessment-sensitivity-analyses}).

We also present an appendix showing results for the sensitivity model that excludes
the age-1 survey index (Appendix~\ref{chap:age1-survey}). The exclusion of the age-1
survey model was chosen because it matches the model structure of the
\Sexpr{assess.yr - 1} base assessment model.

The JTC continues to be committed to advancing MSE analyses, by coordinating
research with the \fishname\ MSE Working Group and other scientists in the region
engaged in similar research. Incorporating feedback from the
Working Group and stakeholders will ensure that operating models will be able to
provide insight into the important questions defined by interested parties.
Specifically, the development of MSE tools will evaluate major sources of
uncertainty relating to data, model structure and the harvest policy for this
fishery, and will compare potential methods to address them. In the coming year,
this will include evaluating the utility of
incorporating environmentally-driven age-0 recruitment indices into the stock
assessment.

\subsection{Reference points}\label{sec:assessment-reference-points}

The term reference points is used throughout this document to describe common
conceptual summary metrics. The Agreement specifically identifies $\Fforty$ as the
default harvest rate and $\Bforty$ as a point where the 40:10 TAC adjustment is triggered
(see the Glossary in Appendix~\ref{chap:glossary}).

We report estimates of the base reference points (e.g., $\Fforty$,
$\Bforty$, $\Bmsy$, and MSY) with posterior credibility intervals in
Table~\ref{tab:main-reference-points}. The
median of the female spawning biomass at $\Fforty$ (namely the median of $\BSPRforty$) and
the median yield at $\Fforty$ are higher than the estimates in the
\Sexpr{last.assess.yr} assessment (Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates}).
% Manual 2021 done

% Look at dfo.probs.curr and decide what to write. Check that
%   ncol(base.model$risks[[1]]) == 10   (i.e. no new columns added)
% ***Have to update custom-knitr-variables (see UNHARDWIRE in that, when have time).
% $
As part of the DFO Sustainable Fisheries Framework, \citet{DFO2009} defined
a limit reference point as being a biomass
below which serious harm is believed to be occurring to the stock,
and an upper stock reference point above which the stock is considered to be healthy.
These would equate to the Agreement reference points of $\Bten$ and $\Bforty$
(the female spawning biomass being 10\% and 40\%, respectively, of the unfished
equilibrium female spawning biomass).
The probabilities of the female spawning biomass
at the start of \Sexpr{assess.yr} being above each of these points
are P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess.yr}} > \Bten) = \Sexpr{probs.curr.bten}$\% and
P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess.yr}} > \Bforty) = \Sexpr{probs.curr.bforty}$\%
[in last year's assessment the equivalent calculation was
P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess.yr-1}} > \Bforty) = 82.2\%$], % hardwired**
such that the stock is estimated to be in the `healthy zone' (above the upper
stock reference point of $\Bforty$).

With respect to DFO's provisional limit reference point
of $0.4\Bmsy$ and provisional upper stock reference point of $0.8\Bmsy$, the probabilities
are P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess.yr}} > 0.4\Bmsy) = \Sexpr{f(dfo.probs.curr[1, 2], 0)}$\% and
P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess.yr}} > 0.8\Bmsy) = \Sexpr{f(dfo.probs.curr[1, 3], 1)}$\%
such that the stock is estimated to be in the provisional `healthy zone'.
For completeness, we note that P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess.yr}} > \Bmsy) = \Sexpr{f(dfo.probs.curr[1, 1], 1)}$\%

%PFMC refrence points for hake/whiting are: Bmsy = 0.4B0; MSST = 0.25B0.  Will report these as well.
Reference levels of stock status that are used by the U.S. Pacific Fisheries Management
Council (PFMC) for \fishname\ include $\Bforty$ and a Minimum Stock Size
Threshold (MSST) of $\Btwentyfive$. For \Sexpr{min(forecast_yrs)}, the estimated
posterior median relative spawning biomass is \Sexpr{curr.depl.median}\%, such
that the spawning biomass is above $\Bforty$ and well
above $\Btwentyfive$.
The probability that spawning biomass at the beginning of \Sexpr{assess.yr}
is above $\Bforty$ is
P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess.yr}} > \Bforty) = \Sexpr{probs.curr.bforty}$\% (as noted above), and of being above $\Btwentyfive$
is
P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess.yr}} > \Btwentyfive) = \Sexpr{probs.curr.btwentyfive}$\%.
% $>\Btwentyfive$ = \Sexpr{probs.curr.btwentyfive}\%.


\subsection{Model projections}\label{sec:assessment-model-projections}

The median catch limit for \Sexpr{min(forecast_yrs)} based on the default
\Ffortyten{} harvest policy is \Sexpr{catch.limit.quantiles["median"]}~t, but
has a wide range of uncertainty (Figure~\ref{fig:main-projected-catch-density}),
with the 95\% credibility interval being
\Sexpr{catch.limit.quantiles["lower"]}--\Sexpr{catch.limit.quantiles["upper"]}~t.

Decision tables give projected population status (relative spawning biomass) and
relative fishing intensity under different catch alternatives for the base model
(Tables~\ref{tab:main-decisions-biomass} and~\ref{tab:main-decisions-spr}). The
tables are organized such that the projected outcome for each potential catch
level and year (each row) can be evaluated across the quantiles (columns) of the
posterior distribution. Table~\ref{tab:main-decisions-biomass} shows projected
relative spawning biomass outcomes, and Table~\ref{tab:main-decisions-spr} shows
projected fishing intensity outcomes relative to the 100\% target (based on SPR;
see table legend).

The tables use the new format demonstrated by
\citet{JTC2021} arising from discussions at the 2021 SRG meeting.
Enhancements include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item showing current spawning biomass once in a single row at the top (\emph{Start 2022})
    rather than repeating it;

  \item showing values as proportions instead of percentages;

  \item removing the 25\% and 75\% columns;

  \item adding a new column, \emph{Biomass year}, which emphasizes the timing of the biomass estimates;

  \item re-naming of the header for the relative biomass values from \emph{Beginning of year relative spawning biomass} to \emph{Resulting relative spawning biomass};

  \item the values shown in the \emph{Resulting relative spawning biomass} columns now represent the biomass at
    the beginning of the year resulting from the catch taken in the previous year,
    as given in the \emph{Catch year} column;

  \item extending the projections of relative spawning biomass to the start of the \emph{third}
   projection year (\Sexpr{assess.yr + 3}), rather than just the second year.
\end{itemize}

Population dynamics and governing
parameters assumed during the forecast period include average recruitment
(no recruitment deviation); selectivity, weight-at-age and fecundity averaged over
the five most recent years (\Sexpr{assess.yr-5}--\Sexpr{assess.yr-1}); and all estimated
parameters constant (at their estimates for each particular MCMC sample).

Relative fishing intensity exceeding 1 (or 100\% when shown as a percentage) indicates fishing in excess of the
$\Fforty$ default harvest rate limit. This can happen for the median
relative fishing intensity in \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[1:(length(forecast_yrs)-1)]}
and \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[length(forecast_yrs)]} because the $\Fforty$ default
harvest-rate catch limit is calculated using baseline selectivity from all
years, whereas the forecasted catches are removed using selectivity averaged
over the last five years. Recent changes in selectivity will thus be reflected
in the projection of overfishing. An alternative catch level where median
relative fishing intensity is 100\% is provided for comparison (catch
alternative~\Sexpr{letters[catch.spr100.ind]}: FI=100\%).

Management metrics that were first identified as important to the Joint Management
Committee (JMC) and the Advisory Panel (AP) in 2012 are presented for
\Sexpr{forecast_yrs[2:(length(forecast_yrs)-1)]} and
\Sexpr{forecast_yrs[length(forecast_yrs)]}
projections
(Tables~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1}--\ref{tab:main-risk-year-3} and
Figures~\ref{fig:main-forecast-depletion-comparison}--\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-3}).
These metrics summarize the probability of
various outcomes from the base model given each potential management
action. Although not linear, probabilities can be interpolated from this table
for intermediate catch
values in \Sexpr{assess.yr} (Table~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1} and
Figure~\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-1}). However, interpolation is
not appropriate for all catches in
\Sexpr{assess.yr+1} and \Sexpr{assess.yr+2} because
they are conditional on previous year(s) catch levels.
%catch alternatives~h and~i have catches
%that are larger than 430,000~t
% \Sexpr{catch_levels[[5]][[1]][1]}
%(the constant catch for alternative~\Sexpr{letters[5]}) in \Sexpr{assess.yr} but smaller% than
% 430,000~t
% \Sexpr{catch_levels[[5]][[1]][1]}
%in \Sexpr{assess.yr+1} (Table~\ref{tab:main-decisions-spr});
This explains why a few probabilities decline
(rather than rise) with increased \Sexpr{assess.yr+1} and \Sexpr{assess.yr+2}
catch levels in Tables~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-2}
and~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-3}
and Figures~\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-2}
and~\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-3}.

Figure~\ref{fig:main-forecast-depletion-comparison} shows the projected
relative spawning biomass trajectory through
\Sexpr{forecast_yrs[length(forecast_yrs)]} for several of these management
actions. With zero catch for the next three years, the biomass has a
\Sexpr{zero.catch.prob.bio.down.1}\% probability of decreasing from
\Sexpr{forecast_yrs[1]} to \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[2]} (Table~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1}
and Figure~\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-1}), a
\Sexpr{zero.catch.prob.bio.down.2}\% probability of decreasing from
\Sexpr{forecast_yrs[2]} to \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[3]} (Table~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-2}
and Figure~\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-2}),
and a
\Sexpr{zero.catch.prob.bio.down.3}\% probability of decreasing from
\Sexpr{forecast_yrs[3]} to \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[4]} (Table~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-3}
and Figure~\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-3}).

% Not needed for 2022, but keep around. It's described in a 2020 or 2021 issue.
%Note that for zero
%catch in Figure~\ref{fig:main-forecast-depletion-comparison}, the median in \Sexpr{end.yr}
%essentially equals the median in \Sexpr{end.yr + 1} (i.e., zero difference in the medians),
%which might be expected to imply a 50\% probability of a decline (not the 65\%
%just mentioned). However, this does not occur because the difference between the
%\Sexpr{end.yr} and \Sexpr{end.yr + 1} medians is not the same as the median of the
%Sexpr{end.yr} and \Sexpr{end.yr + 1} differences.
%The median difference between \Sexpr{end.yr} and \Sexpr{end.yr + 1}
%is a decline of 0.028 (from calculating the difference for each MCMC sample and
%then taking the median). About 15\% of the
%MCMC samples have a decline in the range -0.028 to 0 (a decline greater than the
%median difference but less than the difference in the medians). This accounts for the
%apparent discrepancy in the 50\% and 65\% probabilities.

% possible future use)
The probability of the spawning biomass decreasing from \Sexpr{end.yr} to
\Sexpr{end.yr+1} is under 57\% for all catch levels
(Table~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1} and
Figure~\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-1}). It is 30\% for the
\Sexpr{end.yr} catch level similar to that for \Sexpr{end.yr-1} (catch alternative~f).
%The highest probability of
%decrease is 97\%, which is for the default harvest policy
%(row~g in Table~\ref{tab:es-risk-year-1}).
For all explored catches,
the maximum probability of the spawning biomass dropping below $B_{10\%}$
at the start of \Sexpr{end.yr+1} is 0\%,
at the start of \Sexpr{end.yr+2} is 1\%,
and at the start of \Sexpr{end.yr+3} is 7\%
(Tables~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1}--\ref{tab:main-risk-year-3} and
Figures~\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-1}--\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-3}).
The similar maximum probability of dropping below $\Bforty$
at the start of \Sexpr{end.yr+1} is 18\%,
at the start of \Sexpr{end.yr+2} is 31\%,
and at the start of \Sexpr{end.yr+3} is 44\%.
As the large 2010, 2014, and 2016 cohorts continue to age, their biomass is expected to decrease
as losses from mortality outweigh increases from growth.  The
estimated above-average 2020 cohort will play a large role in determining spawning stock biomass
during the forecast years presented here.

It should be noted
that forecasted biomass is not only influenced by catch levels.
As the large 2010 and 2014 cohorts continue to age, their biomass is
will continue to decrease (Table~\ref{tab:main-cohort-effects})
as losses from mortality outweigh increases from growth. The smaller
above-average 2016 cohort has also entered this growth-mortality transition period
(Table~\ref{tab:main-cohort-effects}).
The below-average 2015 and 2018 cohorts will contribute much less to forecasted spawning
biomass than the larger cohorts. The probability
that the \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[2]} spawning biomass will be less than the
\Sexpr{forecast_yrs[1]} spawning biomass ranges from \Sexpr{f(min(base.model$risks[[1]][,2]))}\% to \Sexpr{f(max(base.model$risks[[1]][,2]))}\%
depending on the catch level (Table~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1} and
Figure~\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-1}).


% This needs to be somewhat manual so you can pick the cohorts to
% specify - look at fore.catch.prop.  Increment the ages each assessment.
**[not incremented manual years yet, see comments and Issue \#920]
The age composition (in numbers) of the catch in \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[1]} is
projected to be (using MCMC medians)
\Sexpr{fore.catch.prop$Age4}\% age-4 fish from the 2017 year-class,
\Sexpr{fore.catch.prop$Age5}\% age-5 fish from the 2016 year-class,
\Sexpr{fore.catch.prop$Age7}\% age-7 fish from the 2014 year-class and
\Sexpr{fore.catch.prop$Age11}\% age-11 fish from the 2010 year-class
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-age-comp-forecast}). However, those estimates are highly
uncertain with the 95\% credibility interval for the age-7 fraction spanning
\Sexpr{f(fore.catch.prop.age7.lower)}\%--\Sexpr{f(fore.catch.prop.age7.upper)}\%.
Due to the lower average weight at age-4 versus age-11, the median expected
proportion of the \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[1]} catch by weight
is \Sexpr{f(fore.catch.prop.wt.age4.median)}\% for the 2017 cohort
(compared to \Sexpr{fore.catch.prop$Age4}\% by numbers)
and \Sexpr{f(fore.catch.prop.wt.age11.median)}\%
for the 2010 cohort
(compared to \Sexpr{fore.catch.prop$Age11}\% by numbers; Figure~\ref{fig:main-age-comp-forecast}).

With respect to the DFO reference points, with the largest

\subsection{Sensitivity analyses }\label{sec:assessment-sensitivity-analyses}

Sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate influence of data inputs and
structural uncertainty of the base model by investigating how changes to the
model affected the estimated values and derived quantities. All sensitivity analyses
compared MCMC posteriors that were created using the {\tt adnuts} R package
\citep{Monnahan2018, Monnahan2019} to implement the NUTS
algorithm with a similar number of posterior samples as the base model. For a comparison of the
parameter estimates for the sensitivity analyses with those from the base model
see Tables~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1}--\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-3}.
Many additional sensitivity runs were conducted when developing and testing the
\Sexpr{assess.yr} base model. Here we focus on the main sensitivities which include
the following:

%**update list (and see earlier also I think)

\begin{enumerate}

\item Consideration of higher standard deviations on the prior distribution
  for natural mortality;

\item Consideration of alternative values for steepness;

\item Assumption of higher/lower variation about the stock-recruitment curve
  ($\sigma_r$);

\item Removal of the age-1 index as a data source;

\item Downweighting fishery age-composition data;

\item Consideration of alternative standard deviations for time-varying
  selectivity; and

\item Consideration of an alternative maximum age for fishery and survey
  selectivity.

%\item Removal of cohort-based ageing error from the model; and

\end{enumerate}

%removing this paragraph for 2022, but should be added back in for 2023
%removed because of discrepency in diagnostic plots (not results really) between
%base and sensitivity runs in 2022
%**[have code to create .pdf - can do again this year] The MCMC diagnostics were examined by creating a document
%containing the equivalent of Appendix~\ref{chap:mcmc-diagnostics} for all
%sensitivity analyses (.pdf file available from the JTC upon request). In general,
%diagnostics were similar to those for the base model. Minor differences include:
%sensitivity analyses related to
%$M$ showed more autocorrelation in $M$ and some failed Heidelberger and Welch
%statistics; the Francis reweighting had a lower effective sample size for most
%parameters; lower standard deviations for time-varying selectivity led to a few
%failed Heidelberger and Welch statistics; the analyses with alternative standard
%deviations for time-varying selectivity and the higher maximum age for
%selectivity both yielded lower effective sample sizes; and all three maximum-age-selectivity
%analyses led to a few failed Heidelberger and Welch statistics.

None of the sensitivities resulted in any substantial departure from
the main population dynamics of the base model. All sensitivity models showed large
estimated increases in spawning biomass in the early- to mid-2010s that continues to be
driven by the 2010, 2014, and 2016 cohorts and a steady reduction in spawning biomass from
high levels over the last few years.  All sensitivity models indicate that \Sexpr{assess.yr}
relative spawning stock biomass is above $\Bforty$. The overall scale of the
population was impacted by various alternative assumptions, and the highly
uncertain size of the recent cohorts were more variable across sensitivity analyses
than earlier cohorts which have been observed for more years.

% Leaving as one long line as easier to comment back in if needed (lots of calcs
% in here). May not be needed anyway.
%%The results of this model relative to the base model are shown in Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-2} and Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-2} and \ref{fig:main-recruitment-base-alternative-2}. In general, the estimated population dynamics are similar, regardless of extrapolation, throughout most of the time series.  However, there is some divergence in recent year estimates; e.g., the estimated relative spawning biomass in \Sexpr{end.yr} is \Sexpr{f(100*sens.models.2.for.table[[1]]$derived_quants["Bratio_2016","Value"],1)}\% for the base model (with extrapolation) and \Sexpr{f(100*sens.models.2.for.table[[2]]$derived_quants["Bratio_2016","Value"],1)}\% for the model without extrapolation. The 2016 default harvest control catch limit coming from the base model is \Sexpr{f(sens.models.2.for.table[[1]]$derived_quants["ForeCatch_2016","Value"])}~t compared to \Sexpr{f(sens.models.2.for.table[[2]]$derived_quants["ForeCatch_2016","Value"])}~t for the model using no extrapolation (using MLE values).

% MLE added to emphasise why numbers are different to usual (MCMC) base model
% ones.
% even though this is generlaized, it is not very general since the index
% number of the list is used

Several key underlying structural model assumptions were identified that have
persisted across many previous hake assessments, and thus warrant revisiting
annually as a set of reference sensitivity examinations to new base models.
Those identified here (as noted above) include the specification of natural mortality, the level
of variation assumed about the stock-recruitment relationship ($\sigma_r$), and
the resiliency of the stock in terms of recruitment (steepness).

% section below on natural mortality sensitivity
% Manual 2021 done - CG
The standard deviation of the prior distribution on natural mortality was
increased from the base model value of 0.1 to 0.2 and 0.3. The median of the MCMC posteriors
for natural mortality increased from
\Sexpr{f(nat_m[2], 3)} with a 95\% credible interval
of \Sexpr{f(nat_m[1], 3)}--\Sexpr{f(nat_m[3], 3)} for the base model (prior standard
deviation of 0.1) to \Sexpr{f(nat_m_03[2], 3)} with a 95\% credible interval
of \Sexpr{f(nat_m_03[1], 3)}--\Sexpr{f(nat_m_03[3], 3)}
for the sensitivity run with the prior standard
deviation set to 0.3 (Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1}). In addition to allowing a higher estimated value for
natural mortality, the broader prior on $M$ also increased the overall scale of
the population, the estimated stock status relative to $B_0$ prior to 1990, the
uncertainty in spawning biomass on both absolute and relative scales, halved estimated relative
fishing intensity in \Sexpr{end.yr-1}, and doubled equilibrium yield at $\BSPRforty$.
(Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1} and Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-1}
and~\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-1}).

% section below on steepness sensitivity
% Manual 2021 done - CG
The mean of the prior distribution on steepness was decreased from 0.777 (base)
to 0.5 and, separately, steepness was fixed at 1.0. The decrease in the mean of the
prior resulted in a decrease in the MCMC estimate of steepness from
a median of \Sexpr{f(steep[2],3)} with a 95\% credible interval
of \Sexpr{f(steep[1], 3)}--\Sexpr{f(steep[3], 3)} to
a median of \Sexpr{f(steep_prior_05[2],3)} with a 95\% credible interval
of \Sexpr{f(steep_prior_05[1], 3)}--\Sexpr{f(steep_prior_05[3], 3)}
(Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1}).
However, neither steepness
sensitivity analysis had an impact on the overall model results
(Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-1} and
\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-1}), because \fishname\ spawning biomass has
remained above levels where changes in steepness would appreciably influence
stock-recruit dynamics (Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-sr-variability}).

% section below on sigma_r
**The value of $\sigma_r$ was changed from a value of 1.4 (base) to alternative
high (1.6) and low (1.0) states. The low value, $\sigma_r = 1.0$,
resulted in a model where the standard deviation of the MLEs of
recruitment deviations in the period with the most informative data was
1.55,
suggesting that the data were inconsistent with the lower value of $\sigma_r$.
The high value, $\sigma_r = 1.6$, resulted in a model with a more
consistent standard deviation for the estimated recruitment deviations, at
1.86.
However, the high $\sigma_r$ model had a larger difference between the
spawning biomass at unfished
equilibrium and the spawning biomass at the initial year of the model
than the low $\sigma_r$ model
(Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1} and
Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-1} and
\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-1}). Similar to previous assessments,
estimates of unfished recruitment ($\log R_0$) and relative spawning biomass are sensitive
to $\sigma_r$, whereas absolute estimates of spawning biomass are insensitive.
The method of \citet{MethotTaylor2011}
considers a combination of the variability among the
estimated deviations and the uncertainty around the estimates using the formula
\eb
\sigma_r^2 = \mbox{Var}(\hat{r}) + \overline{\mbox{SE}({\hat r}_y)}^2,
\ee
where $\mbox{Var}(\hat{r})$ is the variance among deviations and
$\mbox{SE}(\hat{r}_y)$ is the standard error of each estimate. It
produced a suggested
$\sigma_r$ of 1.77, which was slightly more similar to the
base-model value of 1.4 than the 1.81 estimated in the 2021 assessment.
%the sigma R calculated values were done by hand using the posteriors.sso file for each model
%following the above equation using the Main period rec devs

% Manual 2021 done - CG
The sensitivity of the base model to the removal of the age-1 survey index
provides a comparative evaluation of how the base model incorporates information
about juvenile fish. Compared to the base model, estimates
of spawning biomass throughout most of the time series are similar, but do
diverge near the end of the time series
(Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1},
Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-2} and
\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-2}). The \Sexpr{end.yr} estimates of
relative spawning biomass are
\Sexpr{f(100*bratio_curr[2], 1)}\%
for the base model (95\% credible interval
of \Sexpr{f(100*bratio_curr[1], 1)}--\Sexpr{f(100*bratio_curr[3], 1)}\%) and
\Sexpr{f(100*bratio_age1[2], 1)}\%
for the removal of the age-1 index model (95\% credible interval
of \Sexpr{f(100*bratio_age1[1], 1)}--\Sexpr{f(100*bratio_age1[3], 1)}\%)).
This change is likely due to the age-1 index suggesting slightly higher recruitment
in 2014 (age-1 in 2015) and 2016 (age-1 in 2017) and moderately higher in 2018 (age-1 in 2019)
and 2021 (age-1 in 2020) than the model without the index
(Figures~\ref{fig:main-age-one-index} and~\ref{fig:main-recruit-base-alternative-2}).
The largest changes are for the most recent years where the model without the index
has less information about recruitment size.
Removing the age-1 index led to minor changes in fit to the acoustic survey estimates, with
some years showing slight improvement and others a slight deterioration compared to the base
model (Figure~\ref{fig:main-index-base-alternative-2}).
For further details and results from the removal of the age-1 survey index sensitivity see
Appendix~\ref{chap:age1-survey}.

The high age-1 survey index from 2021 is largely in concurrence with
oceanographic conditions, as summarized in NOAA's annual Ecosystem Status Report
of the California Current. Recruitment is generally impacted by oceanographic
conditions both during maternal preconditioning and during egg and larval
stages. During maternal preconditioning (spring-fall, 2019) upwelling
conditions were variable but near average \citep{HarveyGarfieldEtAl2020}. Weaker
upwelling conditions are associated with higher \fishname\ recruitment during this
phase (Vestfals et al., pers. comm.). During egg and larval phases (2020), ocean
conditions were broadly associated with high productivity across many taxa
\citep{HarveyGarfieldEtAl2021}. These conditions were marked by strong winter
upwelling which brings nutrients to coastal waters, cooler temperatures, an
energy-rich copepod community, and high productivity of krill, a key food source
for \fishname\ \citep{BuckleyLivingston1997, HarveyGarfieldEtAl2021}.

% section below on composition weighting
% Manual 2021 done - CG
The base model includes a Dirichlet-multinomial likelihood component,
which uses two estimated parameters to automatically weight each of the fishery and survey age
compositions. The base model was compared to a sensitivity model that downweighted
the fishery age compositions relative to the survey age compositions. The data weighting used
in the sensitivity model was based on the McAllister-Ianelli method.
This method requires manual iterative adjustments to the input sample sizes
using a derived multiplier. The McAllister-Ianelli method, which was used in assessments prior to 2018,
attempts to make the arithmetic mean of the input
sample size approximately equal to the harmonic mean of the effective
sample size. The McAllister-Ianelli method
suggested a weighting factor of 0.14 and 0.46 (ratio of 0.30) for fishery and survey
age compositions, respectively. The median estiamte from Dirichlet-multinomial method
used in the base model was \Sexpr{DM.weight.fishery.median} and
\Sexpr{DM.weight.survey.median} (ratio of
\Sexpr{f(as.numeric(DM.weight.fishery.median) /
as.numeric(DM.weight.survey.median),2)}).
Downweighting fishery composition data using the McAllister-Ianelli method
led to minor changes in relative spawning stock biomass and increased uncertainty
in estimates of early recruitments compared to the base model
(Figures~\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-2} and~\ref{fig:main-recruit-base-alternative-2}).
Another weighting approach, the Francis method, attempts
to make the fit of the expected mean age
lie within the uncertainty intervals at a rate which is consistent
with variability expected based on the adjusted sample sizes. However, as
noted in Section~\ref{sec:data-age-comp-likelihood},
the Francis method is known to be sensitive to outliers and prone to convergence
issues when selectivity is time-varying, as it is in this assessment, and thus was
not included as a sensitivity.

% section below on selectivity
% Manual 2021 - CG
The degree of flexibility of annual variation in the fishery selectivity was tested using
three sensitivities which set alternative values of the $\Phi$ parameter
(Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-4}-\ref{fig:main-index-base-alternative-4}).
The consideration of alternative standard deviations ($\Phi$) for time-varying
selectivity is discussed earlier in
Section~\ref{sec:data-variability-selectivity}. Changing the values of the
parameter $\Phi$ controlling the flexibility in time-varying selectivity from
the base model value of $\Phi = 1.40$ to alternative values of 0.21, 0.70, and 2.10,
did not appreciably influence the estimates, or precision, associated with recruitment
in 2014 (Figure~\ref{fig:main-recruit-base-alternative-4}).
However, recruitment estimates for 2016 and 2017 are linked to the choice of $\Phi$, where the
model with the smallest $\Phi$ at 0.21 estimates the 2016 and 2017 recruitment deviation as
the highest of the $\Phi$ sensitivity models (Figure~\ref{fig:main-recruit-devs-base-alternative-4}),
leading to a large increase in spawning biomass in recent years compared to the base model
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-4}). It also
provides the worst fit to the most recent survey biomass estimate
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-index-base-alternative-4}).

The estimated population trends throughout the time series are similar, irrespective of maximum
selectivity age (Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-6}-\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-6}).
The largest differences are in the mid-1980s when age-composition data was sparse, and then again
over the last few years of the model. The
maximum selectivity at age-5 model resulted in the lowest estimate of the 2016 year class compared
to the other model runs, while runs with higher maximum age produced similar
levels of recruitment but at the cost of a considerable increase in the number of model
parameters (Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-2}).  The choice of age-6 as the
maximum was retained in the base model as it offered more flexibility than the choice of age-5.
%All three alternative runs had reduced
%performance in terms of MCMC diagnostics when compared with the base model.

% Ageing Error
% Did not run this sensitivity in 2022
%The impact of assuming a time-invariant ageing error vector instead of a
%cohort-based ageing error matrix (as in the base model) was evaluated.  The
%largest changes to model results are associated with estimates of equilibrium
%unfished biomass (Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-3} and
%Figure~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-5}) and thus relative spawning biomass
%(Figure~\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-5}). These differences stem from
%the population model being restricted in the time-invariant case to fitting
%age-composition data with a stationary level of measurement error associated
%with each age. There is very little difference in the current relative biomass between the two,
%with the base model having a median relative biomass of \Sexpr{f(100*depl_curr, 1)}\% and
%the time-invariant ageing error vector model having a median relative biomass of
%\Sexpr{f(100*depl_no_ageerr, 1)}\%. The credible interval is larger for the
%time-invariant ageing error vector model.

%Did not run this sensitivity in 2022
%The impact of using the random walk Metropolis Hastings (rwMH) MCMC algorithm with data inputs
%and model structure equivalent to the base model is shown in
%Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-3} and discussed in further details in
%Appendix~**now-removed.

%An additional sensitivity run arising from the Scientific Review Group
%meeting held from 25th February to 28nd February 2020 related to input sample size is documented
%in Appendix~\ref{chap:srg-requests}.
%Briefly, arbitrarily decreasing the weight of recent fishery age-composition data by taking the square root of the input %sample size led to
%similar estimates of the recent trend in spawning biomass but differences in
%stock status because of more optimistic estimates of the stock at unfished
%equilibrium. Further responses to other SRG requests are also given in Appendix~\ref{chap:srg-requests}.

\subsection{Retrospective analyses}\label{sec:assessment-retrospective-analyses}

**Retrospective analyses were performed by iteratively removing the terminal
years' data (going back 10 years) and estimating the posterior distribution of
parameters under the assumptions of the base
model. Models with 3 or 4 years of data removed had some information
available regarding the above-average 2014 year class, but did not yet have information on the
2016 year class (Figure~\ref{fig:main-biomass-recruitment-retrospective}). Models
with 2 and 3 years of data removed were just beginning to receive data on age-3 and age-2, respectively,
individuals to predict the size of the 2016 year class.  The base model now has
\Sexpr{number.to.word(assess.yr - 2016 - 1)} years of data to estimate the size of
the 2016 cohort, and the uncertainty around this
estimate has been considerably reduced compared to three years ago
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-biomass-recruitment-retrospective}). Medians of various
quantities of interest are given in Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-retro}.

**Overall, there is little retrospective change to the relative spawning biomass
trajectory up to the mid-2010s, and most retrospective change occurs in the
final years of the retrospective model with the most years removed
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-biomass-recruitment-retrospective}).
In the previous assessment, the retrospective bias was a mix of both positive and negative
biases in these terminal years. In this assessment, there is very little retrospective bias
other than a positive bias in spawning stock biomass four years previously when the 2014
year class was initially estimated too high. There is no indication from retrospective
evaluations that the base model is displaying a systematic bias.

**Cohort strength is usually not well estimated until the cohort reaches age~3 or more
because at age~3 at least one year of survey age-composition data are available
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-retrospective-recruitment}).
Deviations for the 2010 and 2014 cohorts, which are the largest cohorts since 2010,
exhibit the largest positive deviations.
Estimated recruitment deviations for the 2014 cohort
are above those for 2016 and 2017 cohorts, but the estimated size of the 2014 cohort didn't
fully stabilize until age~4.
The variability among cohort estimates relative to their estimated size
in the base model (Figure~\ref{fig:main-relative-retrospective-recruitment})
further indicates that the estimates can start to improve as early as age~2, but
some estimates of cohort strength may not stabilize until
the cohort approaches an age upward of 7 years old.
The lack of systematic bias in the assessment results could be because
both of the largest cohorts are now older than 7 years old.
This illustrates that multiple observations of each cohort are needed in
order to more accurately determine their recruitment strength.

**A comparison of the actual assessment models used in each year since
\Sexpr{min(assessment.history$Year)} is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-assessments}. There have been substantial
differences in the structural assumptions of the models and,
thus, results submitted each year.
The variability between model results, especially early on in the time
series, is larger than the uncertainty (95\% credibility interval) reported from
any single model in recent years.
Prior to 2004, survey catchability was fixed at 1.0 and this assumption was
heavily investigated between 2004 and 2007, leading to variability in model results
because of the use of several different, but fixed, values of survey
catchability. Since 2008, catchability has been freely estimated by the model.
The fixing of survey catchability had the effect
of driving the estimate of initial biomass upward, which in turn scaled the
entire biomass trajectory up, leading to higher estimates of relative spawning
biomass than in more recent assessments. The median estimates of
spawning biomass for recent years have remained similar to the previous
assessment but declined relative to the 2015-2017 assessments.
The difference is most likely related to the recent under-fitting of the 2017 survey estimate
of biomass despite the consistency in the structure of the assessment model in
recent years.
The uncertainty interval associated with the \Sexpr{end.yr} assessment brackets the majority of the
historical estimates.

\subsection{Performance of past projections}\label{sec:assessment-past-projections}

A comment from an industry representative in 2021 about the probabilities in the
decision tables
(such as Tables~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1} and~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-2})
changing from assessment to assessment led \citet{JTC2021} to
investigate the general question of how much confidence can we have in the
probabilities in the decision tables.

% 2021:
% Doing some numbers manually to get done. Next year can supply Tables also maybe,
% plus automate a bit. Plus do a retrospective analysis now that we have MCMC retros.
% combine_historical_probs(model = base.model, end = assess.yr-1)
% gives the probs, maybe
% worth making a table

As an example, the 2019 assessment provides the estimated probability of the spawning stock
biomass declining in the subsequent year, i.e.,~P($B_{2020} < B_{2019}$),
for several possible catches in 2019 (such as 0~t, 180,000~t,
350,000~t, 410,000~t etc.). Now, in \Sexpr{assess.yr}, we `know' that the catch in 2019 was
411,574~t. Therefore, we can select the 410,000~t row (which is close enough to
411,574~t) in the table from the 2019
assessment to give that assessment's
P$(B_{2020} < B_{2019})=$\Sexpr{prob.decline.from.2019.to.2020.historic}\%, given the catch
that we now know occurred in 2019.

We can also calculate P($B_{2020} < B_{2019}$) using the current
assessment model, i.e.,~calculate our most up-to-date estimate of the probability
that the stock declined from 2019 to 2020 using all available data. This
implicitly includes the 411,574~t catch from 2019. From the current assessment
model we get P$(B_{2020} < B_{2019}) =$\Sexpr{prob.decline.from.2019.to.2020.curr}\%.
The \Sexpr{prob.decline.from.2019.to.2020.historic}\% and
\Sexpr{prob.decline.from.2019.to.2020.curr}\% probabilities
are shown for 2019 in Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-1}.

We extracted similar probabilities from past assessment documents going back to
2012 (Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-1}).
For each assessment year $t$, we take the value of
P$(B_{t+1} < B_{t})$ from year $t$'s stock assessment document, specifically the
row in the decision table corresponding to the
catch that we now know to have occurred in year~$t$.
This can require interpolation between catch levels if
the exact catch in year $t$ was not given in the decision tables in year $t$'s assessment.
We also calculate analogous probabilities,
P$(B_{t+1} < B_{t})$, from the current base model (Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-1}).

The historic probability of P$(B_{2013} < B_{2012}) =$\Sexpr{prob.decline.from.2012.to.2013.historic}\%
from the 2012 assessment is
somewhat above the \Sexpr{prob.decline.from.2012.to.2013.curr}\% calculated using the current assessment model
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-1}). But, this makes sense because the
2012 assessment model had no information that the 2010 recruitment was going to be very large
(it did not include the age-1 index, which in 2011 did indicate a large 2010 recruitment,
Figure~\ref{fig:main-age-one-index}).
However, the current base model does have such information from many years of age
data. Hence, the current model confidently `expects' a large increase in spawning biomass
from 2012 to 2013 as the individuals in the 2010 cohort grew in size. The 2013
assessment model had some information on the 2010 cohort, so the lower estimated
probability that the stock would decline from 2013 to 2014 better concurs with
the current base model than results from the 2012 assessment
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-1}).

For later years, the probabilities vary, but for each year the probabilities
either both lie above the 50\% line or both lie below it (Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-1}),
except for 2018.
So, each assessment correctly predicts whether the stock will increase or
decrease the following year, except for 2018. Also, for all years (except 2018
and 2021)
the assessment
year's probabilities are closer to 50\% than those from the current base
model. Such behavior is desirable and sensible. These probabilities
are for binary events that either happen or do not happen (the stock either
declines or it does not decline, similar to a tossed coin only being a head or a
tail). The current assessment model has more information and thus provides a more
definitive probability (closer to 0\% or to 100\%) than year $t$'s
assessment document. It is desirable that the probabilities from the assessment
documents are not too definitive (too close to 0\% or to 100\%) because they are
admitting a wide range of uncertainty given unknown recruitments. The 2021 assessment's
estimate is very close to that of this year's assessment.

Interestingly, in Figure~B.3.1 of the 2021 assessment \citep{JTC2021} we found that the 2018 probability from the
2021 base model was above
the 50\% line (unlike for this year's base model), agreeing with the 2018
assessment calculation (2018 was also the only
year for which the probability from the 2021 assessment model was closer to 50\%
than that from that year's assessment). The differing results to the current
base model may be because there is no
definitive trend in biomass around that time
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-female-spawning-biomass}), with the median spawning biomass
slightly increasing from 2018 to 2019, whereas it was slightly decreasing in the
equivalent figure in the 2021 assessment. Thus, probabilities of annual decline are
expected to be sensitive to slight changes in results in such cases. Whether
the stock declines or increases is not so important when such changes are small.

From this current \Sexpr{assess.yr} assessment's projections, we show the probabilities for
all catch alternatives in Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-1} because
we do not yet know which will correspond to the \Sexpr{assess.yr}
catch. Catching zero fish in \Sexpr{assess.yr} (colored in pink) obviously gives
the lowest probability that the stock will decline from \Sexpr{assess.yr} to \Sexpr{assess.yr+1}.
All probabilities except the highest catch lie below the 50\% line, consistent with the
expected large size of the 2020 cohort that will increase the spawning biomass
as those fish grow and become mature.

We also provide similar calculations for the
probability of the biomass falling below
$\Bforty$ in the subsequent year (Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-2}),
i.e.,~P$(B_{t+1} < \Bforty)$.
The 2012 assessment gave a $>50\%$ chance of the biomass falling below
$\Bforty$ in the subsequent year. This was the highest such probability from
all assessments and also the poorest performing because the biomass did not fall
below $\Bforty$, thanks again to the very large
2010 year class. The 2013-2017 assessments had information on the 2010 year class
and estimated low probabilities of falling below $\Bforty$. Again, these
estimates are closer to 50\% than those from the current base model (blue dots),
which is desirable behavior as mentioned above -- the assessments gave low
probabilities of an unlikely event occurring that we now believe to have been even more
unlikely to have occurred. Since the 2018 assessment, the estimated probabilities
of the biomass falling below $\Bforty$ were $>10\%$ and
continued to rise (Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-2}), until they fell in this year's assessment
presumably again due to the incoming 2020 cohort.

Probabilities from past assessments lie below those estimated from the
current model (the blue line is below the red line). But, this won't necessarily always
be the case. The probability from the 2021 assessment was the highest since
2012, yet probabilites from this 2022 assessment are much lower. If the incoming
2020 cohort is not as large it currently appears to be, then this would explain
any future overlapping of the blue and red lines.

% In particular, the probabilities calculated
% from projections in this year's assessment, P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess.yr+1}} <
% \Bforty)$, are mostly in the 30\%-50\% range, which has not previously occurred.
Note that the
biomass has been relatively high in the time period shown, so `correctly
expecting' the biomass to remain $>\Bforty$ may not be a particular high bar to
attain. Thus, we
cannot simply conclude that the current assessment's probabilities will also turn out to be
over-estimates of the probability of being $<\Bforty$ once we have more data, although
it does appear from Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-1} that the biomass is not expected to
decline further next year.
% (i.e., the blue line may cross the red line in the future).

Overall, these results suggest good confidence in the
projected probabilities from the assessment model. Past projections of increases
or decreases in the stock the following year have almost always been `correct' (the most
probable direction has agreed with the latest base model and data). And, except for the 2012 assessment
incorrectly expecting the biomass to fall below $\Bforty$ (which did not happen thanks
the large 2010 year class), projections `correctly' estimated the
biomass to not go below $\Bforty$.

Given we have full Bayesian results for the retrospective analyses, we can
calculate restrospective versions of Figures~\ref{fig:main-historical-1}
and~\ref{fig:main-historical-2}. By using data only up to 2011, the current
base model estimates a very low probability of biomass decline from 2012 to 2013,
P$(B_{2013} < B_{2012})$, similar to that from the base model with data from all years
(top panel of Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-retro-1}). However, the 2012 assessment estimated
a much higher probability of 43\%. This difference is presumably due to changes in modelling
framework since 2012 (Table~\ref{tab:main-assessment-changes}).

An obvious relevant
change is the inclusion of the age-1 index in this year's base model. The equivalent retrospective
calculation for the sensitivity run that excludes the age-1 index (and hence excludes
the 2011 age-1 index that gives strong evidence for the large 2010 cohort), gives
P$(B_{2013} < B_{2012}) >20\%$
(grey square in Figure~\ref{fig:historical-retro-all-age1}). This suggest that the age-1 index
accounts for some of the reduction
of P$(B_{2013} < B_{2012})$ from the 2012 assessment's calculation (red circle
in top panel of Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-retro-1}) to the retrospective calculation using the
current base model but data only up to 2011 (grey square in top panel of
Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-retro-1}). However, there
is still a difference between the grey square and red circle at 2012 in
Figure~\ref{fig:historical-retro-all-age1} (excluding the age-1 index), which
is caused by changes in model structure (and any updates in data) since
2012 beyond the inclusion of the age-1 index (else the square and circle would overlap).

For 2013 onwards
(Figures~\ref{fig:main-historical-retro-1}--\ref{fig:main-historical-retro-all}),
the retrospective probabilities (colored squares) are
generally close to the probabilities currently estimated using all available
data (blue triangles), with 2018 again being an exception. All retrospectives are shown together in
Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-retro-all} for ease of comparison.

Of note is that
P$(B_{2016} < B_{2015})$ is close to the current base model's value when using
data up to 2014 (the dark grey square and blue squares at 2015 are close together in the
top panel of Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-retro-2}). Yet, when the 2015 data
are included, the probability falls noticeably (the gold square at 2014 in the middle panel of
Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-retro-2}). It falls further when the 2016 data
are included (the orange square at 2014 in the bottom panel of
Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-retro-2}), and then agrees with the current base
model when the 2017 data are included (the pink square at 2014 in the top panel of
Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-retro-3}). This is presumably explained by the
retrospective analysis of recruitment deviations of the large 2014 cohort. The
2014 cohort is
overestimated (compared to current estimates) when including data up to 2015 and
2016 (the highest two green points for the 2014 cohort in
Figure~\ref{fig:main-retrospective-recruitment}), but then is more consistently
estimated once the 2017 data are included (note that 2017 was a survey
year). The same behaviour is seen when excluding the age-1 index
(Figure~\ref{fig:historical-retro-all-age1}).

The equivalent retrospective figure to Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-2}
for P$(B_{t+1} < \Bforty)$, Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-retro-bforty-all},
shows, in particular, that
P$(B_{2013} < \Bforty)$ when using data up to 2011 (first grey square,
though hidden by other squares) is very low, compared to the 2012
assessment's estimate of $>50\%$. This is also the case (though not quite as
low) when including the age-1 index
(Figure~\ref{fig:historical-retro-bforty-all-age1}), again
suggesting that changes in model
framework beyond inclusion of the age-1 index are impacting
understanding of stock dynamics.
