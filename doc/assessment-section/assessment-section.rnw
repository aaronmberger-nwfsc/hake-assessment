\section{ASSESSMENT}\label{sec:assessment}

\subsection{Modeling history}\label{sec:assessment-modeling-history}

In spite of the relatively short history of fishing, \fishname\ have surely been
subject to a larger number of stock assessments than any marine species off the
west coast of the U.S.A.~and Canada. These assessments have included a large
variety of age-structured models. Initially, a cohort analysis tuned to fishery
CPUE was used \citep{FrancisSwartzmanEtAl1982}. Later, the cohort analysis was
tuned to National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) triennial acoustic survey
estimates of absolute biomass at age \citep{HollowedAdlersteinEtAl1988}.
Since 1989, Stock Synthesis models (or base versions of it) fit to
fishery catch-at-age data and acoustic survey estimates of population biomass
and age composition have been the primary assessment method.

While the general form of the age-structured assessment has remained similar since 1991,
modeling procedures have been modified in a variety of ways. There have been
alternative data choices, post-data collection processing routines,
data-weighting schemes, structural assumptions for the stock
assessment model, MCMC sampling algorithms, and
control rules (Table~\ref{tab:main-assessment-changes}).
Analysts are constantly trying to improve the caliber and relevance of the assessment by
responding to new scientific developments related to statistics and biological dynamics,
policy requirements, and
different or new insights brought up during the peer review process to ensure a robust
stock assessment.

Data processing, filtering, and weighting choices have been modified several times
since the first assessment. For example, modifications to the target-strength
relationship used to scale acoustic data changed in 1997 \citep{DornSaunders1997},
and kriging was implemented to account for the spatial correlation in the
acoustic data in 2010 \citep{StewartHamel2010}.
While survey data have been the key index for
biomass since 1988, surveys that have been used have varied considerably. The
Alaska Fisheries Science Center/Northwest Fisheries Science Center West Coast
Triennial Shelf Survey was used from 1988 before being
discarded from the 2009 assessment \citep{HamelStewart2009}. Acoustic
surveys from the years prior to 1995 were used for assessments in the early
1990s, but \citet{StewartForrestEtAl2011} reviewed these early surveys and
deemed that sampling was insufficient to be comparable with more
recent data. Several recruitment indices have been considered
but ultimately none were identified as adding appreciable contribution to model results
\citep{HelserDornEtAl2002, HelserFleischerEtAl2005, StewartHamel2010}, except for
the fishery-independent acoustic-based age-1 index which has been included
in the base model since the 2022 assessment.
The process for generating fecundity-at-age from weight-at-age data
changed in 2019 from using time-invariant to year-specific values.
Even where data have been consistently used, the weighting of these data
in the statistical likelihood has changed through the use of various emphasis factors
(e.g., \citealt{Dorn1994, DornSaundersEtAl1999}), a multinomial sample
size on age compositions (e.g., \citealt{DornSaundersEtAl1999, HelserDornEtAl2002,
HelserFleischerEtAl2005, StewartForrestEtAl2011}),
internal estimations of effective sample size using the
Dirichlet-multinomial distribution \citep{JTC2018},
and assumptions regarding year-specific
survey variance. Since 2021, a more computationally efficient Bayesian MCMC sampler
(No-U-Turn Sampler; NUTS; \citealt{HoffmanGelman2014}) was used to estimate posterior distributions
\citep{Monnahan2018, Monnahan2019},
a change from previous assessments that used the random walk Metropolis Hastings
(rwMH) sampler (details described in \citealt{JTC2021}).
The list of changes discussed above is for illustrative
purposes only and represents a small fraction of the different choices
analysts have made and that reviewers have required.

The structure of the assessment models has perhaps had the largest number of
changes. In terms of spatial models, analysts have considered
spatially explicit forms \citep{Dorn1994, Dorn1997}, spatially implicit forms
\citep{HelserStewartEtAl2006}, and single-area models \citep{JTC2012}. Predicted
recruitment has been modeled by sampling historical recruitment (e.g.,
\citealt{Dorn1994, HelserFleischerEtAl2005}), using a stock-recruitment
relationship parameterized using maximum sustainable yield ($\text{MSY}$) and
the fishing mortality rate estimated to produce the MSY ($\Fmsy$; \citealt{Martell2010}),
and using several alternative steepness priors \citep{JTC2012,
JTC2013}. Selectivity has also been modeled in several ways:
invariant \citep{JTC2012, JTC2013}, time-varying with \citep{HelserDornEtAl2002}
and without \citep{Dorn1994, DornSaunders1997, JTC2012, JTC2013} a random walk,
alternative levels of allowable deviation through time \citep{JTC2013, JTC2017},
age-based \citep{Dorn1994, DornSaunders1997, JTC2012, JTC2013}, and length-based
\citep{HelserMartell2007}.

Several harvest control rules have been explored for providing catch limits from
stock assessment output. \fishname\ stock assessments have presented decision
makers with constant $F$, variable $F$, and the following hybrid control rules:
$F_{\text{SPR}=35\%}$, $\Fforty$, \Ffortyten, $F_{\text{SPR}=45\%}$,
$F_{\text{SPR}=45\%}$--40:10, and $F_{\text{SPR}=50\%}$ (e.g., \citealt{Dorn1996,
JTC2013}).
Changes to policies such as
the United States' National Standards Guidelines in 2002 and
the \Ffortyten{} harvest control rule in the Agreement (Appendix~\ref{chap:glossary})
have required specific changes to control rules.

In addition to the examples given above and changes documented in stock assessments,
there have been many more investigations conducted at review panel meetings.
Starting in 2013, the addition of the MSE \citep{JTC2013, JacobsenEtAl2021} facilitated
investigating changes to the modeling procedure in terms of pre-specified objectives
that aim for a sustainable coast-wide fishery.

\subsection{Description of base model}\label{sec:assessment-base-model}

The \Sexpr{assess_yr} base model has the same population dynamics structure
as the \Sexpr{last_assess_yr} assessment's base model.
The statistical-catch-at-age model assumes that the
\fishname\ population is a single coast-wide stock subject to
one aggregated fleet with combined male and female population dynamics.
Stock Synthesis \citep{MethotWetzel2013} version \Sexpr{ss_version} was the modeling platform used.
The largest change between the
\Sexpr{last_assess_yr} and \Sexpr{assess_yr} stock assessments is the addition of another
year of
%acoustic survey and
fishery data
%and the incorporation of the age-1 index
into the base model.

The \Sexpr{assess_yr} base model includes a time series (1995 to
\Sexpr{last.survey.year}) of acoustic age-2$+$ biomass
estimates and acoustic estimates of age-1 fish (see
Section~\ref{sec:data-acoustic-survey} for more details on the age-1 index).
Maturity is assumed to be time-invariant and the
maturity ogive updated in 2018 was retained
(see Section~\ref{sec:data-maturity}).
Fecundity is defined as weight-at-age multiplied by the maturity ogive
and is time-varying across years with empirical weight-at-age data
(\Sexpr{start_yr_age_comps}--\Sexpr{last_data_yr}; see Section~\ref{sec:data-weight-at-age}).
The D-M
likelihood approach \citep{ThorsonEtAl2017Dirichlet} is again used to estimate the weights
associated with age-composition data, rather than iteratively tuning the sample size multiplier
as in 2017 and earlier assessments (see
Section~\ref{sec:data-age-comp-likelihood}). Time-varying fishery
selectivity is retained in the \Sexpr{assess_yr} base model with the magnitude
of the allowable deviations unchanged from the \Sexpr{last_assess_yr} base model
(see Section~\ref{sec:data-variability-selectivity}).
The general parameterization of
selectivity was retained, although additional parameters were required to
estimate an additional year of deviations. The selectivity of the acoustic survey is
assumed to be time invariant. Selectivity curves were modeled as
non-parametric functions estimating age-specific values for each age beginning
at age-2 for the index of age-2$+$ biomass
and age-1 for the fishery until a maximum age of 6, after which
all ages are assumed to have the same selectivity.
Selectivity for the age-1 index was set to one for age-1
and zero for all other ages.

Prior probability distributions are used for a select few parameters
and fixed values are used for several parameters. For the base model, the
instantaneous rate of natural mortality ($M$) is estimated with a
\Sexpr{m.prior[1]} prior having a median of
\Sexpr{f(exp(as.numeric(m.prior[2])), 2)}
and a standard
deviation (in log-space) of 0.1 (see
Section~\ref{sec:data-natural-mortality}). The stock-recruitment function is a
Beverton-Holt parameterization, with the log of the mean unexploited recruitment
(log~$R_0$) freely estimated. This assessment uses the same beta-distributed prior for
stock-recruit steepness ($h$), based on \citet{MyersBowenEtAl1999}, that has
been applied since 2011 \citep{StewartForrestEtAl2011}.
Year-specific recruitment deviations were estimated
from \Sexpr{main.recdev.early}--\Sexpr{main.recdev.end+1}
as well as the years \Sexpr{assess_yr-1}--\Sexpr{assess_yr+3}
for purposes of forecasting. The standard deviation,
$\sigma_r$, of recruitment variability serves as a recruitment deviation
constraint and is fixed at
\Sexpr{base_model$sigma_R_in} in this assessment. This value is based on
consistency with the observed variability in the time series of recruitment
deviation estimates and is the same as assumed in assessments from 2013 to
\Sexpr{last_assess_yr} (Table~\ref{tab:main-assessment-changes}).
Catchabilities associated with the biomass index ($q_b$) and with the age-1 index
($q_1$) were
calculated analytically as per \citet{LudwigWalters1981}
for each sample of posterior parameters, resulting in a distribution of catchability
for each.

Statistical likelihood functions used for data fitting are typical of many stock
assessments. The biomass index was fit via a lognormal
likelihood function, using the observed (and extra 2009) sampling variability,
estimated via kriging, as year-specific weighting. The age-1 index was also specified
as having lognormal error structure. An additional constant and
additive standard deviation on the log-scale component is included for both the
biomass index and the age-1 index, which were
freely estimated to accommodate unaccounted-for sources of process and
observation error.
A D-M likelihood was applied to age-composition data,
with input sample sizes equal to the sum of the number of trips and hauls sampled across all
fishing fleets or the number of trawl sets in the research surveys (see Section~\ref{sec:data-age-comp-likelihood}).

Model results and statistical inference were based on
\Sexpr{f(num.mcmc.samples)} MCMC samples (using the {\tt adnuts} R package; \citet{Monnahan2018})
to describe posterior distributions for model
parameters and derived quantities. The number of samples used for bridging models, sensitivity
models, and retrospective models was also \Sexpr{f(num.mcmc.samples)}.
Medians (50\% quantiles) are reported together with the
bounds of 95\% credibility intervals calculated as
the 2.5\% quantile and the 97.5\% quantile of posterior distributions from the
MCMC samples, to give equal-tailed intervals. A full explanation of the NUTS algorithm
and the {\tt adnuts} package, including an analysis with the \fishname\ stock
can be found in \citet{Monnahan2019}.

\subsection{Response to 2022 Scientific Review Group (SRG) review}\label{sec:assessment-response-review}

The Scientific Review Group (SRG) meeting was held virtually from February
14-17, 2022.

The following are the `SRG Recommendations and Conclusions for the Stock
Assessment' from the 2022 SRG report and the associated responses from the
JTC:

1. {\bf The SRG notes that $\sigma_R$ is an influential parameter and that
  determining the choice of $\sigma_R$ remains a challenge and encourages the
  JTC to continue to work on the issue.}

\emph{Response -- Developing best practices for modeling mean unfished equilibrium recruitment ($R_0$)
  and recruitment variability ($\sigma_R$)
  remain broad topics of contemporary research. Recent recommendations suggest that the next
  generation of stock assessment modeling frameworks
  should concomitantly treat recruitment deviations
  as a random effect and estimate $\sigma_R$ \citep{Punt2020}.
  The JTC continues to conduct,
  collaborate on, and monitor ongoing research projects concerning
  approaches for advancing recruitment estimation, as applied to \fishname\ and
  in general. Many of these issues are widespread
  in stock assessment and scientific-based solutions are likely to be the result of medium
  to long-term research projects. Here, we provide a few updates to our previous response on this topic,
  including specific advances in research endeavors where applicable.}

\emph{The JTC continues to participate in collaborative research to investigate the concurrent
  estimation of multiple variance parameters within stock assessments.
  For \fishname, this includes the estimation of the variability associated with
  time-varying selectivity ($\Phi$), $\sigma_R$,
  extra standard deviation parameters on index data, and
  Dirichlet-multinomial parameters $\theta_{\text{fish}}$ and $\theta_{\text{surv}}$.
  In this assessment, $\Phi$ and $\sigma_R$ are input as fixed parameters because
  Stock Synthesis uses penalized likelihood and therefore
  is not formulated to estimate random effects.
  Additionally, estimation of these variance parameters using MCMC
  requires the specification of hyperpriors for which there has been little research.
  The Laplace approximation \citep{ThorsonHicksEtAl2015} was investigated
  as an alternative means to estimate these parameters.
  However, estimates from this method were large and simulation shows them to
  be biased high.
  Additional research still in its infancy suggests that stock assessment frameworks
  with the ability to estimate random effects internally are
  better at estimating autocorrelated processes than random processes.
  Next steps for the JTC includes fitting Stock Synthesis to these
  same data sets to determine best practices when variance parameters cannot be estimated
  and fitting a wide variety of stock assessment frameworks to data when
  multiple random processes are present in the true dynamics.}

\emph{The Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) framework for \fishname\ creates
  considerable advantages for examining recruitment.
  The stock assessment model in the MSE is written in Template Model Builder (TMB),
  which provides efficient estimation of random effects using the Laplace approximation,
  while being parameterized to mimic many (but currently not all) of the pertinent features of
  Stock Synthesis used in this assessment.
  Thus, the performance of using restricted maximum likelihood to estimate $\sigma_R$ \citep{Thorson2019}
  can be investigated in terms of management as well as statistical performance.
  Research projects using the MSE framework are underway to evaluate the robustness
  of recruitment modeling assumptions and the advantages of including environmentally-driven recruitment indices
  on management performance and uncertainty.  Research (under review) by Dr.~Cathleen Vestfals and
  colleagues at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center has identified specific climate drivers associated with
  \fishname\ early life-history stages and recruitment and is being used to
  select which environmental variables to fit as an index of recruitment within the stock assessment model.
  Further development of environmentally-driven recruitment indices using updated environmental predictions
  is also underway. The utility of fitting to a recruitment index will be investigated in terms of
  forecasting skill and management performance within the MSE by the MSE working group.}

\emph{The number of stock assessment frameworks written in TMB or other platforms that allow for
  the estimation of random effects is increasing.
  These frameworks, specifically the
  Woods Hole Assessment Model (WHAM; \citealt{StockMiller2021}) and
  State-Space Assessment Model (SAM; \citealt{NielsenBerg2014})
  are both peer reviewed and currently being used for management.
  The JTC has fit WHAM to data on \fishname\ and
  explored the estimates of several variance parameters that are currently only
  explored via sensitivity analyses in Stock Synthesis.
  Next steps include fitting data using SAM and
  using estimates from both frameworks as inputs to Stock Synthesis.}

\emph{The JTC is also following work being conducted by the International Council for
  the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) Methods Working Group which, among other things,
  is looking at meta-analytical approaches for estimating recruitment parameters. Results
  from this work could be used to develop informative prior distributions on key
  recruitment parameters.
  Deliverables were put on hold as a result of COVID-19 but
  the project continues to be making progress.}


2. {\bf The SRG recommends exploring alternative methods to simulate recruitment in the
projections. Although Stock Synthesis currently does not have the capability to
characterize a different process other than the assumed lognormal distribution,
improvements such as drawing from past observations or using a mixture
distribution to simulate recruitment should be considered for modelling platforms
in the future.}

\emph{Response -- The JTC continues to explore approaches to make informed decisions about
  current and future recruitment in projections. The inclusion, and associated justification,
  of the age-1 index in the 2022 and 2023 base model is one example of this (see
  Sections~\ref{sec:data-acoustic-survey} and~\ref{sec:assessment-base-model}).
  Additionally, the JTC is working with Dr.~Kristin Marshall to further explore the fit
  of oceanographic and environmental
  variables identified by Dr.~Cathleen Vestfals as being informative about the
  early life history of \fishname\ as indices of recruitment within Stock Synthesis.
  Ongoing research includes expanding the variables (originally only amalgamated
  from 1980--2010) to 2010 onwards to create a single
  time series, and investigating relationships leading to better informed
  recent, current, and potential near-term forecast recruitment estimates.}

\emph{Available options in Stock Synthesis
  for recruitment during the projection period are the stock-recruitment curve,
  the stock-recruitment curve with a multiplier, and the mean
  across a user-defined time period.  The MSE tool could be used
  to consider alternative recruitment distributional assumptions as future research.
  A member of the JTC is on the development team for NOAA's next generation stock assessment modeling
  platform (Fisheries Integrated Modeling System; FIMS), which ensures features such as recruitment forecast options
  will be taken into consideration. Plans are for the \fishname\ stock assessment to be a test
  model.}

\emph{The JTC has requested DFO funding to collaborate with Australian, U.S.,
  and Canadian researchers on developing two potential approaches for
  developing an index of age-0 \fishname. The first approach is based on the
  method of
  \citet{SuthersWhiteEtAl2022}, who proposed and simulation-tested a novel
  method for estimating growth and mortality of fish larvae based on size
  distributions. In 2022, Suthers visited NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center to
  start applying the method to CalCOFI data (which
  include 1.3 million hake larvae) and compare results to estimates of
  recruitment from the last hake assessment \citep{JTC2022}.
  The second approach will apply a
  method proposed by \citet{HinchliffePepinEtAl2019} that relates the
  mortality/growth ratio of larval fish to the slope of the zooplankton size
  spectrum (which characterises the size distribution of zooplankton)
  to quantify the recruitment
  potential of larval \fishname. The proposed work will support collaborations to
  work on both approaches, will utilise recent improvements in fitting size
  spectra to data \citep{EdwardsRobinsonEtAl2020}, and aims to provide new information
  on \fishname\ recruitment.}

\emph{We also include Figure~\ref{fig:main-recruitment-scale-all} (as developed
  in the 2022 assessment) which presents a novel approach to visualise
  estimates of recruitment, to avoid
  misunderstanding of how large some recruitment events might be.}

3. \fishname\ dynamics are highly variable even without fishing mortality. {\bf The SRG
applauds the efforts of the JTC and the MSE Working Group to add capabilities for
specifying dynamic reference points within the assessment and MSE platforms, and
encourage those groups to work together and develop a discussion of alternative
reference points, including dynamic reference points, for future SRG consideration.}

\emph{Response -- The JTC agrees that future reference point discussions stemming
  from simulation work, preferably through the MSE, would be beneficial. In particular,
  the JTC continues to have interest in exploring the utility of dynamic reference points.
  The MSE can now utilize dynamic reference points in management procedure
  scenarios, and Stock Synthesis models can now incorporate dynamic reference point
  capabilities into routine stock assessment output. In the coming year, the JTC plans to
  initiate simulations that explore alternative dynamic F-based target reference points coupled
  with static (equilibrium-based) biomass limit reference points in exploratory harvest control
  rule scenarios.}

\emph{Over the past year, the JTC has continued to engage in research activities and outreach related to
  dynamic reference points broadly, as well as specifically for \fishname.  In particular, the JTC
  conducted a learning session at the summer JMC meeting to promote internal awareness
  and basic understanding of the key concepts, methods, and assumptions associated with dynamic reference
  point calculations. The JTC also engaged with external partners, the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries
  Commission science provider (Secretariat of the Pacific Community), to learn from their experience developing
  and applying dynamic reference points to operational highly migratory species assessments and management plans.
  Additionally, the JTC is contributing to, and following, updates to Canadian and United States national guidance
  documentation on the incorporation of prevailing environmental conditions into stock assessments and
  subsequent management advice (e.g., defining reference points).}


4. The SRG encourages work to develop a picture of the \fishname\ reproductive cycle
both seasonally and at the life-time scale based on histological and
physiological measurements. In addition, the SRG notes that Canadian samples and those from the
winter research cruises should be included in the maturity analysis. {\bf The SRG
encourages continued sampling and analysis to improve understanding of the
\fishname\ reproductive cycle.}

\emph{Response -- \fishname\ ovary samples were not collected over the past year, but plans include more
  sample collections in the coming years. Including Canadian samples in subsequent maturity analyses still
  remains a goal, but barriers (lab training, capacity, and moving bio-samples across the border) still
  remain. Research is in-progress by Melissa Head (NWFSC) focusing on temporal and spatial trends
  in hake reproduction. The analysis will include over a decade of maturity samples, spanning much of the U.S.
  West Coast.  The project aims to evaluate how interannual changes affect size and age at maturity across a latitudinal
  gradient and how the timing of spawning and rate of skip spawning differs spatio-temporally. A presentation
  summarizing progress to date and future plans is planned for the SRG meeting.}

\emph{Research being led by Adam Luckenbach at the Northwest Fisheries
  Science Center looking at physiological
  indices of fish reproductive and metabolic status is expected to bolster the current
  practice of using gonadal histology alone for surveyed \fishname\ and provide important data to more accurately
  determine the reproductive cycle of females. Data generated to date indicate that two types of lipids,
  triacylglycerols and phospholipids, in the livers of \fishname\ are inversely related and predictive
  of sexual maturity in females. Levels of these lipids are also considerably shifted when aborted, atretic
  ovarian follicles are observed, suggesting that lipid levels may be predictive of skipped spawning,
  which can reduce the effective female spawning biomass. Data analyses will continue in 2023.
  New developments are expected to inform maturity in future \fishname\ stock assessments.}


5. {\bf The SRG also recommends continuing to conduct the following sensitivities:
steepness, natural mortality, $\sigma_R$ , excluding the age-1 index, alternative standard
deviations for time-varying selectivity, and down-weighting fishery age-composition
data.}

\emph{Response -- The JTC has conducted all of the requested sensitivities (and many
  others) and provides summaries in written (Section~\ref{sec:assessment-sensitivity-analyses}),
  tabular (beginning with Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1}), and
  graphical (beginning with Figure~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-1}) formats in
  this document.}

6. Based on the preliminary results shown, previous assessments have correctly predicted an
increase or decrease in recruitment and female spawning biomass in subsequent years, although
the projections are usually less definitive than the current base model results. Given that
this analysis provides some confidence in the current expectations of continued stock
decline, {\bf the SRG recommends that the JTC continue to explore and refine this
analysis for future assessments. The SRG encourages the JTC to explore, with the
JMC and AP, the value of a threshold for specifying the probability of projected
declines or increases of the stock in future assessments.}

\emph{Response -- The JTC has again updated this analysis
  to continue comparing estimates from the current base model with forecasts from
  previous assessments
  (Figures~\ref{fig:main-historical-1}--\ref{fig:main-historical-retro-bforty-all}).
  Related, the JTC is continuing to explore options for improving recruitment
  estimation and predictions (see Responses~1--4 and~7).}

\emph{The JTC has not had an opportunity to meet with JMC, AP, or the MSE working group
  to explicitly explore threshold values for specifying the probability of projected
  declines or increases of the stock in future assessments. This endeavor is well suited
  for upcoming MSE-related performance metrics discussions.}


7. The SRG notes that there are currently multiple strong cohorts in the stock
where previously there was only one strong cohort during the period of sample
collection for the ageing error matrix that supports the assessment model. {\bf Based
on this observation, the SRG recommends that an ageing error study using samples
collected during the past decade be conducted in conjunction with the Committee
of Age Reading Experts (CARE).}

\emph{Response -- An ageing error study in conjunction with CARE has commenced, including
  planned sample exchanges between United States and Canada ageing labs. However, a full exchange
  remains on hold due to difficulties with permits to send biological specimens across the border.}

8. {\bf The SRG recommends that historical sources of data be investigated to
determine whether they can be used to supplement the weight-at-age matrix},
including unaged otolith samples (and associated data) from the 1970s that may
be available in the Burke Museum in Seattle.

\emph{Response -- The JTC has conducted analyses previously showing that small changes to
  historical data have little relevance to current management quantities of interest. So at this time,
  the JTC does not expect small amounts of historical weight-at-age data to significantly alter
  stock assessment results used for management decisions. The JTC has not had the opportunity to
  visit the Burke Museum in Seattle to ascertain whether \fishname\ age structures are available and
  in a usable state.}

9. Uncertainty in weight-at-age is not accounted for in the stock assessment
and a five-year average of recent observations is used for all years of the
projections. {\bf The SRG requests that the JTC explore alternative methods for
forecasting weight-at-age and evaluate whether they can improve projections.}

\emph{Response -- It is important to capture key, mechanistic, and/or stochastic population processes
  in stock assessment projections to sufficiently characterize levels of prediction uncertainty
  that are consistent with available information to adequately contextualize metrics used to aid
  management decisions. Likewise, it is as important to evaluate the basic population-dynamics
  assumptions used in such projections. Recent, current, and future recruitment are perhaps the most
  influential sources of uncertainty in stock assessment projections. As a result, the JTC has
  prioritized research on recruitment, including supporting analyses and other related analyses
  mentioned in this section. Over the next few years, the JTC plans to work with the MSE working group
  on a newly funded research project aimed at incorporating environmentally-driven growth into the
  operating model and testing consequences of climate-driven changes in recruitment, growth,
  and movement concomitantly.}

\emph{Empirical weight-at-age data indicate inter-annual variation in \fishname\ growth, and this variation could
  be related to individual cohort effects (e.g., large cohorts have a negative growth influence on
  adjacent cohorts). The JTC has future plans to explicitly evaluate these relationships using random effects
  models to partition the variance components (year and cohort) in available weight-at-age data and to explore
  spatial patterns \citep{Indiveroetal2023}. This work could rely or build upon research currently in progress
  by a graduate student looking at variation in \fishname\ weight-at-age data.
  The JTC also plans to explore new weight-at-age forecasting capabilities
  in Stock Synthesis (once fully tested). A simulation experiment that evaluates the influence of variable
  weight-at-age data relative to other sources of variance in stock assessment projections (e.g., recruitment)
  would also be useful. Until this work is completed, the JTC continues to use
  a recent five-year average in the projection period because it is consistent with recent data
  (Figures~\ref{fig:main-empirical-weight-at-age} and~\ref{fig:main-weight-at-age-lines}).
  This assumption is consistent with what is allowable within other commonly used stock assessment
  frameworks that accommodate time-varying dynamics.}


10. The parameter weighting the acoustic survey age samples was often estimated near the
upper bound of 1.0 and could not upweight the age samples. Investigations during the
SRG meeting showed that the posterior distribution of the parameter may have some
probability of upweighting the age samples from the base assessment inputs, although
likely had little difference on stock assessment outcomes. {\bf The SRG encourages the JTC
to consider methods to determine the maximum input sample size for the survey age
compositions. Previous work of \citet{StewartHamel2014} may be useful for this
purpose.}

\emph{Response -- The JTC concurs that determining maximum input sample sizes, as well as
  relative maximums across years, is a worthwhile endeavor. Determining appropriate input
  samples sizes for composition data is a long-standing issue with much debate. Progress made for
  \fishname\ will undoubtedly provide useful for stock assessment more broadly.  The JTC has yet to
  undertake any specific analyses investigating input sample sizes. Researchers at the
  Alaska Fisheries Science Center have recently begun similar inquires, indicating that a collaborative
  approach may be mutually beneficial.}

11. The use of high-performance computing (e.g., a dedicated server or cloud computing)
allowed for the complete set of assessment results to be characterized using MCMC at a
minimal cost. {\bf The SRG recommends future use of high-performance computing to
provide complete and thorough assessment results in a timely manner.}

\emph{Response -- Resources were made available for the JTC to use a new high-performance computing
   network server with 80 processors to complete all model runs (bridging, base, sensitivity, retrospectives, and
   forecasts).
   Another high-performance server unit and two high-performance laptops have also been acquired for
   completing the \fishname\ assessment.  These resources are used for data preparation, diagnostic examination,
   running test models, and exploring alternative model configurations.}

\emph{A new server was purchased and used to run all the models and for running the software that builds

\subsubsection{Changes from \Sexpr{last_assess_yr} }\label{sec:assessment-changes}

% manual 2023 KFJ
A set of `bridging' models was constructed to evaluate the component-specific
effects of the steps to change from the \Sexpr{last_assess_yr} base model to
the \Sexpr{assess_yr} base model. The steps are:
\begin{itemize}
  % For 2024, check the order of these:
  \item Update to the latest version of Stock Synthesis, version
    \Sexpr{ss_version}, to follow current best practices;
  \item Add new catch data for \Sexpr{last_data_yr} and update historical catches;
  \item Add weight-at-age data for \Sexpr{last_data_yr} and update historical weight-at-age data;
  %\item Update acoustic survey biomass and age-composition data from years prior to \Sexpr{last_data_yr};
  %\item Add the \Sexpr{last_data_yr} acoustic survey biomass and age-composition estimates;
  %\item Add the age-1 index time series; and
  \item Add fishery age-composition data for \Sexpr{last_data_yr} and update historical fishery age-composition data.
\end{itemize}

% manual 2023 KFJ
Stock Synthesis version \Sexpr{ss_version} includes
a number of changes since the version used by \citet{JTC2022}. Changes relevant
to this assessment include a fix to the forecasting module that ensures
weight-at-age information in the first year of the forecast is as specified
rather than carried forward from the previous year. This fix was implemented and
used in the \Sexpr{last_assess_yr} assessment for all forecasts provided to
management. Additional changes were made to Stock Synthesis to ensure models
that use empirical weight-at-age data do not report tables in the output that
use growth parameters because even though growth parameters are not used they
must still be provided as placeholders in the input files. Adaptations within
the Stock Synthesis modeling framework itself had little effect on parameter
estimates compared to the \Sexpr{last_assess_yr} base model and thus no effect
on resulting time series (Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel-1}).

The update of pre-\Sexpr{last_data_yr} data occurs because databases are
continually updated; this
yielded minor adjustments to the data.
Samples that were recently aged but not available for the \Sexpr{last_assess_yr}
assessment were included.
These changes to pre-\Sexpr{last_assess_yr} data were small enough that they had
little impact on the model results and are thus combined with steps that add
data from the \Sexpr{last_data_yr}.

The addition of the \Sexpr{last_data_yr} catch data extends the model
to the start of \Sexpr{assess_yr}.
Recruitment estimates and historical stock
trajectory were relatively unchanged, and the new data suggest
a slight increase in female spawning
biomass from \Sexpr{assess_yr-1} to \Sexpr{assess_yr}
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel-1}).
Adding the weight-at-age data for \Sexpr{last_data_yr} makes little change,
though slightly increases the estimated female spawning biomass
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel-1}).

%%Only include an updated version of the following paragraph during survey years
%Including the \Sexpr{last_data_yr} fishery-independent biomass estimate and
%age compositions led to a slightly more optimistic
%trajectory of the stock over the last couple of years
%(Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel-1}),
%whereas updating the 2019 survey biomass estimate itself had negligible
%effect. The addition of \Sexpr{last_data_yr} survey data led to small shifts
%in expected recruitment, particularly for the 2016, 2017, and 2018 year classes.
%The 2018 year class is estimated to be higher in this
%assessment than in the \Sexpr{last_assess_yr} assessment, but it still remains
%a below-average year class.
%This increase is largely driven by the addition
%of the 2021 acoustic-survey age compositions, because this
%was the first time
%the 2018 and 2019 cohorts were adequately sampled (age-2 or older) by the survey,
%which is why the uncertainty associated with these cohorts was reduced (though
%still quite uncertain; Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel-1}).

%%Only include an updated version of the following paragraph during survey years
%Adding the \Sexpr{last_data_yr} fishery-independent age-1 index information as an
%additional source of information to inform recent
%recruitment (Section~\ref{sec:data-acoustic-survey}) resulted
%in a slight increase in estimated recent recruitment, most noticeably for the 2018 and 2020 year
%classes (Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel-2}), and
%increase in virgin recruitment. In turn, this results in a slightly higher
%trajectory of female spawning biomass from 2013--2022 and a change in 2022
%median relative spawning biomass from
% round(median(bridge_models_2[[1]]$mcmc$Bratio_2022),3)*100}\%. to
% round(median(base_model$mcmc$Bratio_2022),3)*100}\%.

The final step added the fishery age-composition data for \Sexpr{last_data_yr}, which
shifted the ending year of the deviations
in the selectivity parameters from \Sexpr{last_data_yr-1} to
\Sexpr{last_data_yr}.
These data had relatively little impact on the historical biomass estimates,
%indicating that the observed \Sexpr{last_data_yr} ages were consistent with the model
%estimates without those data (Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel-1}).
but did shift recent recruitment estimates (Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel-1}).
The estimated 2019 recruitment decreased, while the estimated large 2020 cohort
was shifted even larger.
The increase in 2020 recruitment contributes to a considerable increase
in female spawning biomass by the start of \Sexpr{assess_yr}, as these fish are
considered mostly mature at the start of \Sexpr{assess_yr}.
Despite both fishery age compositions and the relative age-1 index pointing towards
a strong 2020 cohort, estimates of \Sexpr{assess_yr} female spawning biomass remain highly uncertain,
largely due to underlying uncertainty in recent recruitment
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel-1}). Uncertainty related to the 2020 cohort should
decrease once these fish have been observed by the acoustic survey and
the fishery during \Sexpr{last_data_yr+1}.

\subsubsection{Assessment model results}\label{sec:assessment-model-results}

\subsubsub{Model Fit}

Stationarity of the posterior distribution for model parameters was
assessed via a suite of standard single-chain and multi-chain diagnostic tests
via graphical summaries and interactive web applications ({\tt ShinySTAN};
\href{https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/shinystan}{https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/shinystan}).
Key diagnostic figures are given in Appendix~\ref{chap:mcmc-diagnostics} and now
discussed.
All estimated parameters showed good mixing
during sampling, no evidence for lack of convergence, and acceptable autocorrelation
(results for some key parameters are shown in
Figures~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-diag-m-r0}--\ref{fig:main-mcmc-diag-dm}).
Correlation-corrected effective sample
sizes were sufficient to summarize the posterior distributions and neither the
Geweke nor the Heidelberger and Welch statistics for these parameters exceeded
critical values more frequently than expected via random chance
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-diag-hists}).
The Gelman-Rubin multi-chain diagnostic test,
which compares within-chain variance to among-chain variance, further indicated that
convergence was adequately achieved (examined via {\tt ShinySTAN}).
Correlations among key parameters were
generally low, with the exception of $M$ and $\log R_0$ (Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-pairs}).
Estimates of recruitment in 2014 and 2016 were correlated with
the derived quantity of catch from the default harvest rule in \Sexpr{end_yr},
as to be expected given the dependencies
among these quantities (Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-pairs}). An examination of
deviations in recruitment (log-scale differences between estimated and expected
recruitment values) from recent years
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-pairs-recruit-devs}) indicates the highest
correlation
(\Sexpr{round(cor(base_model$mcmc$Main_RecrDev_2014,base_model$mcmc$Main_RecrDev_2016),2)})
was between the 2014 and 2016 recruitment deviations. This is an increase in correlation
relative to the last assessment despite the fact that each cohort has been observed for
an additional year.

Regarding the Dirichlet-multinomial parameter $\theta_{\text{fish}}$,
the estimate (median and 95\% credible interval) for $\log \theta_{\text{fish}}$ is
\Sexpr{log.theta.fishery.median}
(\Sexpr{log.theta.fishery.025},
\Sexpr{log.theta.fishery.975}),
giving an effective sample
size multiplier $\theta_{\text{fish}} / (1 + \theta_{\text{fish}})$
of
\Sexpr{DM.weight.fishery.median}
(\Sexpr{DM.weight.fishery.025},
\Sexpr{DM.weight.fishery.975}).
The related survey age-composition parameter $\theta_{\text{surv}}$ has
\protect{$\log \theta_{\text{surv}}$} estimated as
\Sexpr{log.theta.survey.median}
(\Sexpr{log.theta.survey.025},
\Sexpr{log.theta.survey.975}),
and the resulting effective sample
size multiplier $\theta_{\text{surv}} / (1 + \theta_{\text{surv}})$
of
\Sexpr{DM.weight.survey.median}
(\Sexpr{DM.weight.survey.025},
\Sexpr{DM.weight.survey.975}).

The base model fit to the
acoustic survey biomass index (Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-survey-fit})
remains similar to the \Sexpr{last_assess_yr} base model, which is not surprising
given no new survey information is available for this assessment.
For the \Sexpr{last_assess_yr} base model the \Sexpr{survey_end_yr} survey biomass estimate resulted in a slight upward shift
in the fit to the \Sexpr{penult.survey.year}
survey data points, but the result of a relatively stable biomass trend from 2013--2019
remained unchanged from the previous assessment.
At the time, the addition of the 2021 fishery data
was the main reason for this change in fit to the 2019 data point.
The 2021 survey estimate was lower than in 2019 (second lowest since 2013),
and the model fit indicates a slight decline in biomass from 2019 to 2021.
The 2001 survey biomass index continues to be well below any model predictions that were evaluated,
and no direct cause for this is known.  The survey did begin earlier that year than all other surveys
between 1995 and 2009 (Table~\ref{tab:main-survey-history}), which may explain
some portion of the anomaly, along with El Ni\~no conditions and age structure.
The underestimation of the 2009 biomass estimate is larger than
the underestimation of any other year.
The uncertainty of this point (both modeled and actual) is high
because of the presence of large numbers of Humboldt Squid during the
survey. Humboldt Squid have similar target strength to hake
which could introduce bias in the biomass estimate for that year, and
which also likely influenced hake population dynamics through predation in that year.

The median posterior density estimates from the fit to the survey were less than the 2015 survey index,
greater than the 2017 and 2019 survey indices, and
closely fit the 2021 index (Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-survey-fit}).
This is likely due to slight differences in what the fishery composition data
and survey composition data, when considered independently, would otherwise
suggest as population trends.
Additionally, the population has undergone recent high, but declining, catch levels and produced
a couple of above-average cohorts that are now mature.
%resulting in a population
%trend that has been relatively stable from 2013 to \Sexpr{survey_end_yr}.

The base model fit to the index of age-1 fish highlights
an overall general confirmation of relative cohort strength
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-age1-fit}). In particular,
the 2008 and 2014 cohorts were estimated to be less than the index, while the
1994 and 2016 cohorts were estimated to be larger than indicated by the index.
The age-1 fish in 2011 (the large 2010 cohort) was closely fit.  Age-1 fish in 2021 (2020 cohort)
were estimated slightly above the index value and, being so young, include a large amount of uncertainty.
The model indicates that the 2020 cohort may be similar in
size to the 2014 cohort, based on information in the age-1 index, age-1 fish
caught in the 2021 fishery, and from age-2 fish caught in the 2022 fishery.
The high age-1 survey index from 2021 is largely in concurrence with
oceanographic conditions, as summarized in NOAA's annual Ecosystem Status Report
of the California Current \citep{HarveyGarfieldEtAl2021}.
Recruitment is generally impacted by oceanographic
conditions both during maternal preconditioning and during egg and larval
stages. During maternal preconditioning (spring-fall, 2019) upwelling
conditions were variable but near average \citep{HarveyGarfieldEtAl2020}. Weaker
upwelling conditions are associated with higher \fishname\ recruitment during this
phase (Vestfals et al., under review). During egg and larval phases (2020), ocean
conditions were broadly associated with high productivity across many taxa
\citep{HarveyGarfieldEtAl2021}. These conditions were marked by strong winter
upwelling which brings nutrients to coastal waters, cooler temperatures, an
energy-rich copepod community, and high productivity of krill, a key food source
for \fishname\ \citep{BuckleyLivingston1997, HarveyGarfieldEtAl2021}.

Fits to the age-composition data continue to show close correspondence to the
dominant and small cohorts observed in the data
when the data give a consistent signal
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-age-comp-fits}). Because of the time-varying fishery
selectivity, the fit to commercial age-composition data is particularly good,
although models with time-invariant selectivity used in previous years also fit
the age compositions well.
In the \Sexpr{last_data_yr} fishery, \Sexpr{top.coh(base_model, last_data_yr, 3, cap = FALSE)}.
Age compositions from the \Sexpr{survey_end_yr} acoustic survey suggest a similar age
structure
%i.e., \Sexpr{top.coh(base_model, survey_end_yr, 3, cap = FALSE, fleet = 2)}
for older fish. The 2020 cohort has not yet been observed by the acoustic survey.
Combined, the 2015--\Sexpr{last_data_yr} fishery age-composition data and the
2017--\Sexpr{survey_end_yr} acoustic survey age-composition data
suggest that 2014 was a strong recruitment
year, and the model was able to adequately
fit to these observations (Figure~\ref{fig:main-age-comp-fits}).
The 2016 cohort, which has been observed twice by the survey,
%\Sexpr{ceiling((survey_end_yr-2016)/2)} times
still appears to be smaller than
the 2014 cohort.
The \Sexpr{survey_end_yr} survey was the first to sample the
\Sexpr{survey_end_yr-2} cohort, confirming that
it
was not large (\Sexpr{survey.a2.prop}\% of the \Sexpr{survey_end_yr} survey catch).
The 2020 cohort, which has been observed twice by the fishery, once by the age-1 index, but
not the acoustic survey is currently expected to be above average in size. Residual
patterns to the fishery and survey age data do not show patterns that would
indicate systematic bias in model predictions
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-age-comp-pearson}).

The median estimates for numbers, biomass,
exploitation rate, and catch (in numbers and in biomass) for each age class in
each year are given in
Tables~\ref{tab:main-est-numbers-at-age}-\ref{tab:main-est-catch-at-age-biomass}.
For the major cohorts, the resulting estimated age-specific catch, natural mortality, and
surviving biomasses are given in Table~\ref{tab:main-cohort-effects}.
For example, the catch weight of the 2014 cohort at age-5 was slightly less
than that of the 2010 cohort at age-5 and the resulting surviving biomass of
the 2014 cohort was approximately half of the surviving biomass of the 2010
cohort.

Posterior distributions for both steepness and natural mortality are
influenced by priors
(Figures~\ref{fig:main-prior-posterior}--\ref{fig:main-prior-posterior-truncated}).
The posterior for
steepness is only slightly updated by the data, as expected given the low
level of information available to inform steepness as found in previous hake assessments.
The posterior of natural mortality, on the other hand, is shifted to the right of the prior
distribution and the prior may be constraining the posterior distribution from shifting
further. Broadening
the prior distribution by increasing the prior standard deviation for the natural mortality
parameter is examined in sensitivity runs (see Section~\ref{sec:assessment-sensitivity-analyses}).
Other parameters showed updating from diffuse priors to posterior
distributions, including $\theta_{\text{fish}}$ and  $\theta_{\text{surv}}$ (as outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:data-age-comp-likelihood}).

The \Sexpr{assess_yr} base model specified the same level of variation (standard
deviation of $\Phi = \Sexpr{sel.Phi.val}$) associated with time-varying fishery selectivity as
the \Sexpr{last_assess_yr} base model, effectively
allowing the model flexibility (i.e., a lower penalty on the overall
likelihood) to fit to data that suggests high variability among years for each
age. This level
of variation led to results that remained consistent with the \Sexpr{survey_end_yr} acoustic survey
biomass estimate and gave reasonable fits to the fishery age-composition data,
given that there is considerable uncertainty associated with
spatial changes in fish availability (due to movement) and recent
variability in oceanographic conditions. Estimated selectivity deviations for
age-3 and age-4 fish are larger from
2010 to 2012 than in subsequent years until 2020 when the deviation for age-4 was large again (Figures~\ref{fig:main-tv-selex}
and~\ref{fig:main-tv-selex-uncertainty}). The median selectivity peaks at age-4
in 2010, 2012 and 2020 and at age-3 in 2011 suggesting targeting (or generally higher
availability) of the younger cohorts
in those years. This pattern is consistent with the 2008 cohort appearing strong
in the fishery age compositions initially, but decreasing in prominence
from 2013 onward (Figure~\ref{fig:main-age-comp-fits}).
Fishery selectivity on age-2 fish was at its highest
in 2016.
Fishery selectivity for the most recent year was characteristic by a logistic
pattern, where selectivity generally increased smoothly from age 3
to a peak at age 6 and older ages
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-tv-selex-uncertainty}). However, age-2 selectivity was slightly
higher than for other younger fish, likely as a result of increased availability
of the above-average 2020 cohort. Even though the
survey selectivity is time invariant, the
posterior shows a broad band of uncertainty between ages 2 and 5
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-tv-selex-uncertainty-lines}). The decline in
survey selectivity between ages 3 and 4 may be an artifact of the interaction
between large cohorts and the biennial timing of recent surveys, with the
2010, 2014, and 2016 cohorts occurring in the survey at ages 3 and 5 but not age 4.
Fishery selectivity is
likewise very uncertain (Figures~\ref{fig:main-tv-selex-uncertainty}
and~\ref{fig:main-tv-selex-uncertainty-lines}), but in spite of this
uncertainty, changes in year-to-year patterns in the estimates are still
evident, particularly for age-2, age-3, and age-4 fish, though these patterns might also
reflect time-varying mortality processes.

\subsubsub{Stock biomass}

The base stock assessment model indicates that, since the 1960s, \fishname\
female spawning biomass has ranged from well below to above unfished
equilibrium (Figures~\ref{fig:main-female-spawning-biomass}
and~\ref{fig:main-relative-spawning-biomass} and
Tables~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior} and \ref{tab:main-ci-posterior}). The
model estimates that it was below the unfished equilibrium in the 1960s,
at the start of the assessment period, due to lower than average recruitment.
The stock is estimated to have increased rapidly and was above unfished equilibrium
in the mid-1970s and mid-1980s (after two large recruitments in the early 1980s).
It then declined steadily to a low in 1999. This
was followed by a brief increase to a peak in 2002 as the
very large 1999 year class matured. The 1999 year class largely supported the fishery
for several years due to relatively small recruitments between 2000 and
2007. With the aging 1999 year class, median female spawning biomass declined
throughout the late 2000s, reaching a time-series low of
\Sexpr{median.bio.min}~million~t in \Sexpr{median.bio.min.year}. The assessment
model estimates that median female spawning biomass then peaked again in 2013 and 2014 due
to a very large 2010 year class and an
above-average 2008 year class. The subsequent decline from 2014 to 2016 is primarily
from the 2010 year class surpassing the age at which gains in weight from growth
are greater than the loss in weight from mortality (growth-mortality transition).
The 2014 year class is estimated to be large, though not as large as the 1999
and 2010 year classes, resulting in an increased biomass in 2017. The estimated
biomass was relatively steady from 2017 to 2019, and then declined in 2020
and 2021 due to the 2014 and 2016 year classes moving through the growth-mortality
transition during a period of high catches. The increase in female spawning biomass since 2021 is
due to the expected above average 2020 cohort entering maturity and
the recent declining trend in catch.

The median estimate of the \Sexpr{end_yr} relative spawning biomass (spawning
biomass at the start of \Sexpr{end_yr} divided by that at unfished equilibrium,
$B_0$) is \Sexpr{curr.depl.median}\%. However, the uncertainty
is large, with a 95\%
posterior credibility interval from \Sexpr{curr.depl.lower}\% to
\Sexpr{curr.depl.upper}\% (Tables~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior} and
\ref{tab:main-ci-posterior}), due to remaining unknowns about the size
of the 2020 cohort because the
acoustic survey only provided one year of age-1 information,
which is more uncertain than the 2+ estimate.

The median estimate of
the \Sexpr{end_yr} female spawning biomass is \Sexpr{curr.bio.median}~million~t (with a
95\% posterior credibility interval from \Sexpr{curr.bio.lower} to
\Sexpr{curr.bio.upper}~million~t). The current estimate of the \Sexpr{end_yr-1} female
spawning biomass is \Sexpr{prev.bio.median}
(\Sexpr{prev.bio.lower}--\Sexpr{prev.bio.upper})~million~t. This is a somewhat higher
median and broader credibility interval than the \Sexpr{prev.bio.median.last.assess}
(\Sexpr{prev.bio.lower.last.assess}--\Sexpr{prev.bio.upper.last.assess})~million~t estimated
in the \Sexpr{end_yr-1} assessment, but there is considerable overlap of the credibility
intervals.
The increase appears to be due to the addition of 2022 fishery age composition data, which suggests
the 2020 cohort may be larger than the age-1 index alone was indicating in the last assessment (as outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:assessment-changes}).   % copied to Exec Summary also.

\subsubsub{Recruitment}

The new data for this assessment do not
significantly change the pattern of recruitment estimated in recent assessments.
However, estimates of absolute recruitment for the most recent years can change with
new data.
For example, this assessment's median estimate of the 2020 recruitment is
\Sexpr{f(((recruitment.med.to.compare - prev.assess.recruitment.med)["2020"]), 1)}~billion
fish higher than in the last assessment
(a \Sexpr{f(((((recruitment.med.to.compare - prev.assess.recruitment.med)["2020"]) /
(prev.assess.recruitment.med)["2020"]) * 100), 0)}\% increase).
Similarly, estimates for 2019 and 2021 recruitments have changed by
\Sexpr{f(((((recruitment.med.to.compare - prev.assess.recruitment.med)["2019"]) /
(prev.assess.recruitment.med)["2019"]) * 100), 0)}\%
(\Sexpr{f((recruitment.med.to.compare - prev.assess.recruitment.med)["2019"], 1)}~billion fish) and
\Sexpr{f(((((recruitment.med.to.compare - prev.assess.recruitment.med)["2021"]) /
(prev.assess.recruitment.med)["2021"]) * 100), 0)}\%
(\Sexpr{f(((recruitment.med.to.compare - prev.assess.recruitment.med)["2021"]), 1)}~billion fish),
respectively, but the general notion remains that recent recruitment is highly uncertain.

\fishname\ have low average recruitment with occasional large year classes
(Figures~\ref{fig:main-recruitment} and \ref{fig:main-recruitment-devs},
Tables~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior} and \ref{tab:main-ci-posterior}).
Very large year classes in 1980, 1984, and 1999 supported much of the commercial
catch from the 1980s to the mid-2000s. From 2000 to 2007, estimated recruitment
was at some of the lowest values in the time series, but this was followed by an above average
2008 year class. The very strong
2010 year class comprised \Sexpr{top.coh(base_model, 2014, spec.yr=2010)}\% of the coast-wide
commercial catch in 2014,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base_model, 2016, spec.yr=2010)}\% of the 2016 catch,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base_model, 2018, spec.yr=2010)}\% of the 2018 catch,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base_model, 2020, spec.yr=2010)}\% of the 2020 catch, and
\Sexpr{top.coh(base_model, 2022, spec.yr=2010)}\% of the 2022 catch.
The decline from 2014 to 2016
was partly due to the large influx of the 2014
year class (\Sexpr{top.coh(base_model, 2016, spec.yr=2014)}\% of the 2016 catch was age-2 fish from the
2014 year class; this was larger than the proportion of age-2 fish,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base_model, 2012, spec.yr=2010)}\%, from the 2010 year
class in 2012).

The current assessment also estimates a strong 2014 year class
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-numbers-at-age}) comprising
\Sexpr{top.coh(base_model, 2016, spec.yr=2014)}\% of the 2016 catch,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base_model, 2017, spec.yr=2014)}\% of the 2017 catch,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base_model, 2018, spec.yr=2014)}\% of the 2018 catch,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base_model, 2019, spec.yr=2014)}\% of the 2019 catch,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base_model, 2020, spec.yr=2014)}\% of the 2020 catch
\Sexpr{top.coh(base_model, 2021, spec.yr=2014)}\% of the 2021 catch, and
\Sexpr{top.coh(base_model, 2022, spec.yr=2014)}\% of the 2022 catch.
The 2016 cohort also appears to be above average, comprising
\Sexpr{top.coh(base_model, 2018, spec.yr=2016)}\% of the 2018 catch,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base_model, 2019, spec.yr=2016)}\% of the 2019 catch,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base_model, 2020, spec.yr=2016)}\% of the 2020 catch, and
\Sexpr{top.coh(base_model, 2021, spec.yr=2016)}\% of the 2021 catch, and
\Sexpr{top.coh(base_model, 2022, spec.yr=2016)}\% of the 2022 catch.
The absolute size of the 2014 year
class has now stabilized after observations across eight years of fishery observations
and three acoustic surveys. The 2016 year class is
estimated to be above average (similar in size to the 2008 year class) from six years
of fishery data and two years of survey data.
% years.since.2010.recruitment.med.below.mean  to see all years, then see figure
% for 'well below':
Since 2020, the model currently estimates small 2011, 2013, 2015, 2018, 2019,
and 2021 year classes (median recruitment well below the mean of all median recruitments) and near
average 2012 and 2017 year class.
With the addition of the age-1 index, there is information beyond just fishery encounters in
the data to estimate the size of the 2020 year class. Collectively, these data
indicate that the 2020 year class is likely well above average. The much smaller 2019 year class is
informed by the \Sexpr{last.survey.year} biomass index and fishery data, but has no age-1 index,
and the 2021 year class is only informed by fishery data.
There is no information in the data to estimate the sizes of the
\Sexpr{end_yr-1} and \Sexpr{end_yr} year classes. Retrospective analyses of year
class strength for young fish have shown the estimates of recent recruitment to
be unreliable prior to at least model age-3 (observed at age-2) without a survey in the
most recent year and age-2 (observed at age-1) with a survey. While the 2020 cohort was observed
by the age-1 index in 2021, it will not be observed by the acoustic survey until 2023.

%The additional data in the 2020 assessment has decreased the median estimate of the
%2014 year class to
%\Sexpr{recruitment.med.in.2014}~billion fish (Table~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior}),
%from the \Sexpr{last.assess.recruitment.med.in.2014}~billion estimated in the 2020 assessment (Table~25 of \citealt{JTC2020}).
%The 2014 year class remains the fifth largest estimated recruitment, albeit
%with large uncertainty (Table~\ref{tab:main-ci-posterior} and
%Figure~\ref{fig:main-recruitment}).  The median estimate for the 2016 year class
%is \Sexpr{recruitment.med.in.2016}~billion fish
%(\Sexpr{recruitment.lower.in.2016}--\Sexpr{recruitment.upper.in.2016}~billion fish; Tables~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior} and
%\ref{tab:main-ci-posterior}).

%The proportion of the fishery catch that was age-1 fish
%in 2019 (2018 year class) and 2020 (2019 year class) was well below that observed in 2018
%(2017 year class) and 2017 (2016 year class; Table~\ref{tab:main-all-age-data-fishery}).
% See exec-summary text, and look at this also:
%

From Figure~\ref{fig:main-recruitment} it looks
as though the 2014 recruitment could be as large as the 2010 recruitment.
However, the assessment model
estimates a \Sexpr{prob.percent.2014.rec.gt.2010.rec}\% chance that this
could be the case.
The overlapping of the credible intervals in Figure~\ref{fig:main-recruitment} is because large
MCMC estimates of 2010 recruitment are associated with large estimates of 2014
recruitment (presumably with large estimates of $R_0$).
By scaling all recruitments by the 2010 recruitment,
Figure~\ref{fig:main-recruitment-scale-all} provides an intuitive way to compare
recruitment across years
(see Appendix~H of \citealt{JTC2022} for motivation and full methods).
It shows that there have only been two historical recruitment events (1980 and 1984) that
might be as large as in 2010, whereas Figure~\ref{fig:main-recruitment}
suggests that 1970, 1999 and 2014  could also possibly be larger than in 2010, giving an
over-optimistic impression of how often we can expect cohorts the size of the
2010 cohort to occur. The 2020 cohort is still very uncertain but has a
\Sexpr{prob.percent.2020.rec.gt.2010.rec}\% chance of exceeding the 2010 cohort, while the
2021 cohort is definitely smaller than the 2010 cohort (Figure~\ref{fig:main-recruitment-scale-all}).
Participants in the \fishname\ process have an
intuition that the 2010 is a very large recruitment event --
Figure~\ref{fig:main-recruitment-scale-all} shows how it is the largest for at least
30 years, and that such large cohorts are rarer than is inferred from
Figure~\ref{fig:main-recruitment}.

The estimated recruitments with uncertainty for each year and the
overall stock recruit relationship are provided in
Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-sr-variability}. Extremely large variability about the
expectation and about the joint uncertainty of individual recruitment and female
spawning biomass pairs are evident. High and low recruitments have
been produced throughout the range of observed female spawning biomass
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-sr-variability}). The standard deviation of the time
series of median recruitment deviation estimates for the years 1970--\Sexpr{last_data_yr - 1}, which
are informed by the age compositions and the age-1 index, is
\Sexpr{sd.med.recr.dev.estimates}.

\subsubsub{Exploitation status}

The median estimated relative fishing intensity on the stock is below
$\Fforty$ for all years
% sort(median.intensity)    % 2017 assessment 1999 was slightly over
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-fishing-intensity} and
Tables~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior} and \ref{tab:main-ci-posterior}).
It was close
to $\Fforty$ in 2008 and 2010, but harvest in those years did not exceed
the catch limits that were specified, based on the best available science and
harvest control rules in place at the time.
% Also close in 1999 but no TAC then according to landings.vs.tac[34,], so
%  don't mention 1999.
Exploitation fraction (catch divided
by biomass of fish of age-2 and above) has shown relatively similar patterns
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-exploitation-fraction} and
Tables~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior} and
\ref{tab:main-ci-posterior}). Although displaying similar patterns, the exploitation
fraction does not necessarily correspond to fishing intensity because fishing
intensity more directly accounts for the age-structure of both the population and
the catch.
Median relative fishing intensity is estimated to have declined from
\Sexpr{median.intensity.2010}\% in 2010 to \Sexpr{median.intensity.2015}\%
in 2015, and then it leveled off around 70\% from 2016 to 2019 before declining to
\Sexpr{median.intensity.2022}\% in 2022.
The median exploitation fraction has increased from a recent low of
\Sexpr{exploitation.med.2012} in 2012 to \Sexpr{exploitation.med.2017} in 2017 where it
remained relatively stable before dropping back to 2012--2015 levels in 2022.
Although there is a considerable amount of imprecision
around these recent estimates due to uncertainty in recruitment and spawning
biomass, the 95\% posterior credibility interval of relative fishing intensity
was below $\Fforty$ from 2012 through 2016 and again from 2019
to 2022 (Figure~\ref{fig:main-fishing-intensity}). The median estimate
for 2017 and 2018 is below $\Fforty$ though the 95\% posterior
credibility interval does include $\Fforty$.

% Note that exploitation.med.penult.yr comes out as 0.06, but in Table d
%  is 0.065, because the true value is 0.0648.... The text rounds to two decimal
%  places but Table rounds to three, but rounding is done correctly because of
%  the automation; i.e. we haven't incorrectly rounded up to 0.07, which we
%  could happen from looking at Table d (if the true value wasn't checked). Nice.

\subsubsub{Management performance}

Over the last decade (\Sexpr{end_yr-10}--\Sexpr{end_yr-1}), the mean coast-wide
utilization rate (i.e., proportion of catch target removed) has been
\Sexpr{tot.last.10.years.attainment}\% and catches have been below
coast-wide targets (Table~\ref{tab:main-landings-tac}). From \Sexpr{end_yr-5} to
\Sexpr{end_yr-1}, the mean utilization rates differed between the United States
(\Sexpr{usa.last.5.years.attainment}\%) and Canada
(\Sexpr{can.last.5.years.attainment}\%).
In 2015, the utilization rate for the
coast-wide fishery was the lowest of the previous decade
(\Sexpr{tot.2015.attainment}\%) due, in part, to difficulties locating
aggregations of fish and possibly economic reasons.
% Manual done 2020 - check above sentence with
%  landings.vs.tac[landings.vs.tac$Year %in% (end_yr-10):(end_yr-1),10].  % $
Before 2015,
the underutilization in the United States was mostly a result of unrealized
catch in the tribal apportionment, while reports from stakeholders in Canada
suggested that hake were less aggregated in Canada and availability had
declined. In 2016, the utilization rate increased but remained below pre-2015
levels, despite the total 2016 catch being one of the highest of the preceding years.
This is in large part due to increasing catch targets as biomass continues to
increase. While the total utilization rate between 2017--2021 was relatively steady
and close to the average over the last decade (\Sexpr{tot.last.10.years.attainment}\%),
it decreased in 2022 to \Sexpr{tot.last.year.attainment}\%. This is primarily due
to the utilization rate in Canada declining since 2020
to a time-series low of 20.3\% in 2022.
Country-specific
quotas (or catch targets) in 2020 and 2021 were specified unilaterally, due to the lack of
an agreement on coast-wide 2020 and 2021 TACs. The usual
\Sexpr{us.allotment.percent}\% and
\Sexpr{can.allotment.percent}\% allocation of coast-wide TAC, as specified in the Joint U.S.-Canada
Agreement for \fishname, was once again implemented in 2022.
%During the last two years, utilization rates have been stable
%in both the United States (\Sexpr{usa.last.2.years.attainment}\%) and Canada
%(about \Sexpr{can.last.2.years.attainment}\%).
Total landings last exceeded the coast-wide quota in 2002 when utilization was 112\%.
% Manual done 2023 (double checked numbers).

As noted above, the median relative fishing intensity was below $\Fforty$ in all years.
%the 1999 year used to be just above 1 but now estimated to be just below 1

%  length(median.intensity.above.one.years) > 1
%\Sexpr{median.intensity.above.one.years[length(median.intensity.above.one.years)]}
The median relative spawning biomass was
above the $\Bforty$ reference point in all years except 2007--2010
(Table~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior} and Figure~\ref{fig:main-relative-spawning-biomass}).
% 2017 assessment: all years except 1968, 1998-2000 and 2007-2011

% Andy summarising those years manually, based on:

% Manual done 2020. Interesting that years are becoming fewer.
These are also shown on a phase plot of the joint history of relative spawning biomass
and relative fishing intensity
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-phase}).
%Between 2007 and 2011, however, median relative
%fishing intensity ranged from \Sexpr{median.intensity.2007.to.2011.min}\% to
%\Sexpr{median.intensity.2007.to.2011.max}\% and
%median relative spawning biomass
%between \Sexpr{median.relative.bio.2007.to.2011.min} and
%\Sexpr{median.relative.bio.2007.to.2011.max}.
Relative spawning biomass increased from the lows in 2007--2010 with above average
recruitment in 2008, 2010, 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2020. Correspondingly, relative fishing
intensity has remained well below $\Fforty$, and total catch has been declining since the
time series high in 2017.
% Relative spawning biomass has been
% above the target since \Sexpr{median.relative.bio.above.target.since}.
While
there is large uncertainty in the \Sexpr{end_yr-1} estimates of relative fishing
intensity and relative spawning biomass, the model estimates a \Sexpr{joint.percent.prob.above.below}\%
joint probability of being both above the $\Fforty$ relative fishing intensity in
\Sexpr{end_yr-1} and below the $\Bforty$ relative spawning biomass level at the
start of \Sexpr{end_yr}.

\subsection{Model uncertainty}\label{sec:assessment-model-uncertainty}

The base assessment model integrates over the substantial uncertainty associated
with several important model parameters including: biomass index and age-1 index catchabilities
($q_b$ and $q_1$, respectively), the magnitude of the stock (via the $R_0$ parameter for equilibrium
recruitment), productivity of the stock (via the steepness parameter, $h$, of
the stock-recruitment relationship), the rate of natural mortality ($M$), annual
selectivity for key ages, recruitment deviations, and survey and fishery data
weights (via the Dirichlet-multinomial parameters
$\theta_{\text{fish}}$ and $\theta_{\text{surv}}$).

The medians of the key parameters from the posterior distribution are similar to
those in last year's base model (Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates}).
The largest change was a doubling of the 2020 cohort size.
Medians of some of the derived quantities also change somewhat; in particular,
recruitment in 2019 and 2015 decreased (39\% and 11\%, respectively) from those
estimated in the \Sexpr{assess_yr - 1} assessment.

The \fishname\ stock displays a very high degree of recruitment variability,
perhaps the largest of any west coast groundfish stock, resulting in large and
rapid biomass changes. This volatility, coupled with a dynamic fishery that
potentially targets strong cohorts (resulting in time-varying selectivity)
will in most circumstances continue to result in highly uncertain
estimates of current stock status and even less-certain projections of the stock
trajectory. This is particularly true for female spawning biomass estimates in \Sexpr{assess_yr}
and throughout the current forecast period, because there is considerable uncertainty
associated with the size of the 2020 year class, now mostly mature, that propagates into
forecasts. Further observations of this year class, including during the 2023 acoustic
survey, will help to refine these estimates and reduce uncertainty.
The addition of the age-1 index in this assessment will, in some cases, help
to reduce this uncertainty (as it currently does in this case;
see Figure~\ref{fig:main-recruit-base-alternative-2} discussed later). However,
further work is needed
to improve upon the characterization of uncertainty in the age-1 index itself,
which is based on a time invariant assumption about index observation error
and catchability.

Uncertainty measures in the base model underestimate the total uncertainty in
the current stock status and projections, because they do not account for
alternative structural models for hake population dynamics and fishery processes
(e.g., recruitment, selectivity, or spatial fleet or population structure), the
effects of alternative data-weighting choices, survey catchability, and the scientific basis for prior
probability distributions. To address structural uncertainties, the JTC investigated
a range of alternative models, and we present the key sensitivity analyses along with
other informative sensitivity analyses using full MCMC results
(Section~\ref{sec:assessment-sensitivity-analyses}).

%We also present an appendix showing results for the sensitivity model that excludes
%the age-1 survey index (Appendix~\ref{chap:age1-survey}). The exclusion of the age-1
%survey model was chosen because it matches the model structure of the
%\Sexpr{assess_yr - 1} base assessment model.

The JTC continues to be committed to advancing MSE analyses, by coordinating
research with the \fishname\ MSE Working Group and other scientists in the region
engaged in similar research. Incorporating feedback from the
Working Group and stakeholders will ensure that operating models will be able to
provide insight into the important questions defined by interested parties.
Specifically, the development of MSE tools will evaluate major sources of
uncertainty relating to data, model structure and the harvest policy for this
fishery, and will compare potential methods to address them. In the coming years,
this will include a host of research evaluations
(see Section~\ref{sec:assessment-response-review} and
Section~\ref{sec:research}), including evaluating the
utility of incorporating environmentally-driven age-0 recruitment indices into
the stock assessment.

\subsection{Reference points}\label{sec:assessment-reference-points}

The term `reference points' is used throughout this document to describe common
conceptual summary metrics. The Agreement specifically identifies $\Fforty$ as the
default harvest rate and $\Bforty$ as a point where the 40:10 TAC adjustment is triggered
(see the Glossary in Appendix~\ref{chap:glossary}).

We report estimates of the base reference points (e.g., $\Fforty$,
$\Bforty$, $\Bmsy$, and MSY) with posterior credibility intervals in
Table~\ref{tab:main-reference-points}. The
median of the female spawning biomass at $\Fforty$ (namely the median of $\BSPRforty$) and
the median yield at $\Fforty$ have remained about the same as estimates in the
\Sexpr{last_assess_yr} assessment (Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates}).
% Manual 2021 done

% Look at dfo.probs.curr and decide what to write. Check that
%   ncol(base_model$risks[[1]]) == 10   (i.e. no new columns added) % $
% ***Have to update custom-knitr-variables (see UNHARDWIRE in that, when have time).
As part of the DFO Sustainable Fisheries Framework, \citet{DFO2009} defined
a limit reference point as being a biomass
below which serious harm is believed to be occurring to the stock,
and an upper stock reference point above which the stock is considered to be healthy.
These would equate to the Agreement reference points of $\Bten$ and $\Bforty$
(the female spawning biomass being 10\% and 40\%, respectively, of the unfished
equilibrium female spawning biomass).
The probabilities of the female spawning biomass
at the start of \Sexpr{assess_yr} being above each of these points
are P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess_yr}} > \Bten) = \Sexpr{probs.curr.bten}$\% and
P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess_yr}} > \Bforty) = \Sexpr{probs.curr.bforty}$\%
such that the stock is estimated to be in the `healthy zone' (above the upper
stock reference point of $\Bforty$).
This probability was higher than in last year’s assessment, where
the equivalent calculation was P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess_yr-1}} > \Bforty) = 90.5\%$], % hardwired**
Note that a probability of `100\%' (or
`0\%') is based
on the MCMC results, and is not meant to imply that something definitely occurs
(or definitely does not occur).

With respect to DFO's provisional limit reference point
of $0.4\Bmsy$ and provisional upper stock reference point of $0.8\Bmsy$, the probabilities
are P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess_yr}} > 0.4\Bmsy) = \Sexpr{f(dfo.probs.curr[1, 2], 0)}$\% and
P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess_yr}} > 0.8\Bmsy) = \Sexpr{f(dfo.probs.curr[1, 3], 1)}$\%
such that the stock is estimated to be in the provisional `healthy zone'.
For completeness, we note that P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess_yr}} > \Bmsy) = \Sexpr{f(dfo.probs.curr[1, 1], 1)}$\%.

%PFMC refrence points for hake/whiting are: Bmsy = 0.4B0; MSST = 0.25B0.  Will report these as well.
Reference levels of stock status that are used by the U.S. Pacific Fisheries Management
Council (PFMC) for \fishname\ include $\Bforty$ and a Minimum Stock Size
Threshold (MSST) of $\Btwentyfive$. For \Sexpr{min(forecast_yrs)}, the estimated
posterior median relative spawning biomass is \Sexpr{curr.depl.median}\%, such
that the female spawning biomass is well above $\Bforty$ and $\Btwentyfive$.
The probability that female spawning biomass at the beginning of \Sexpr{assess_yr}
is above $\Bforty$ is
P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess_yr}} > \Bforty) = \Sexpr{probs.curr.bforty}$\% (as noted above), and of being above $\Btwentyfive$
is
P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess_yr}} > \Btwentyfive) = \Sexpr{probs.curr.btwentyfive}$\%.
% $>\Btwentyfive$ = \Sexpr{probs.curr.btwentyfive}\%.


\subsection{Model projections}\label{sec:assessment-model-projections}

The catch limit for \Sexpr{min(forecast_yrs)} based on the default
\Ffortyten{} harvest policy has a median of
\Sexpr{catch.limit.quantiles["median"]}~t and
a wide range of uncertainty (Figure~\ref{fig:main-projected-catch-density}),
with the 95\% credibility interval being
\Sexpr{catch.limit.quantiles["lower"]}--\Sexpr{catch.limit.quantiles["upper"]}~t.

Decision tables give projected population status (relative spawning biomass) and
relative fishing intensity under different catch alternatives for the base model
(Tables~\ref{tab:main-decisions-biomass} and~\ref{tab:main-decisions-spr}). The
tables are organized such that the projected outcome for each potential catch
level and year (each row) can be evaluated across the quantiles (columns) of the
posterior distribution. The tables use the new format demonstrated by
\citet{JTC2021} arising from discussions at the 2021 SRG meeting.
Table~\ref{tab:main-decisions-biomass} shows projected
relative spawning biomass outcomes, and Table~\ref{tab:main-decisions-spr} shows
projected fishing intensity outcomes relative to $\Fforty$ (based on SPR;
see table legend).

Population dynamics and governing
parameters assumed during the forecast period include random recruitment;
selectivity, weight-at-age and fecundity averaged over
the five most recent years (\Sexpr{assess_yr-5}--\Sexpr{assess_yr-1}); and all estimated
parameters constant (at their estimates for each particular MCMC sample).

Relative fishing intensity exceeding 1 (or 100\% when shown as a percentage) indicates fishing in excess of the
$\Fforty$ default harvest rate limit. This can happen for the median
relative fishing intensity in \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[1:(length(forecast_yrs)-2)]}
and \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[(length(forecast_yrs)-1)]} because the $\Fforty$ default
harvest-rate catch limit is calculated using baseline
selectivity-at-age (1966--1990; prior to time-varying deviations),
whereas the forecasted catches under the default
harvest-rate are removed using selectivity averaged
over the last five years. Recent changes in selectivity could be reflected
in the projection of over- or under-fishing relative to the desired $\Fforty$ rate.
%An alternative catch level where median
%relative fishing intensity is 100\% is provided for comparison (catch
%alternative~\Sexpr{letters[catch.spr100.ind]}: FI=100\%).

Key management metrics are presented for
\Sexpr{forecast_yrs[2:(length(forecast_yrs)-1)]} and
\Sexpr{forecast_yrs[length(forecast_yrs)]}
projections
(Tables~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1}--\ref{tab:main-risk-year-3} and
Figures~\ref{fig:main-forecast-depletion-comparison}--\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-3}).
These metrics summarize the probability of
various outcomes from the base model given each potential management
action. Although not linear, probabilities can be interpolated from this table
for intermediate catch
values in \Sexpr{assess_yr} (Table~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1} and
Figure~\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-1}). However, interpolation may not
be applicable for all catches in
\Sexpr{assess_yr+1} and \Sexpr{assess_yr+2} because
they are conditional on previous year(s) catch levels.
%catch alternatives~h and~i have catches
%that are larger than 430,000~t
% \Sexpr{catch_levels[[5]][[1]][1]}
%(the constant catch for alternative~\Sexpr{letters[5]}) in \Sexpr{assess_yr} but smaller% than
% 430,000~t
% \Sexpr{catch_levels[[5]][[1]][1]}
%in \Sexpr{assess_yr+1} (Table~\ref{tab:main-decisions-spr});
This explains why a few probabilities decline
(rather than rise) with increased \Sexpr{assess_yr+1} and \Sexpr{assess_yr+2}
catch levels in Tables~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-2}
and~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-3}
and Figures~\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-2}
and~\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-3}.

Figure~\ref{fig:main-forecast-depletion-comparison} shows the projected
relative spawning biomass trajectory through
\Sexpr{forecast_yrs[length(forecast_yrs)]} for several of these management
actions. With zero catch for the next three years, the biomass has a
\Sexpr{zero.catch.prob.bio.down.1}\% probability of decreasing from
\Sexpr{forecast_yrs[1]} to \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[2]} (Table~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1}
and Figure~\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-1}), a
\Sexpr{zero.catch.prob.bio.down.2}\% probability of decreasing from
\Sexpr{forecast_yrs[2]} to \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[3]} (Table~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-2}
and Figure~\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-2}),
and a
\Sexpr{zero.catch.prob.bio.down.3}\% probability of decreasing from
\Sexpr{forecast_yrs[3]} to \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[4]} (Table~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-3}
and Figure~\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-3}).

% Not needed for 2022, but keep around. It's described in a 2020 or 2021 issue.
%Note that for zero
%catch in Figure~\ref{fig:main-forecast-depletion-comparison}, the median in \Sexpr{end_yr}
%essentially equals the median in \Sexpr{end_yr + 1} (i.e., zero difference in the medians),
%which might be expected to imply a 50\% probability of a decline (not the 65\%
%just mentioned). However, this does not occur because the difference between the
%\Sexpr{end_yr} and \Sexpr{end_yr + 1} medians is not the same as the median of the
%Sexpr{end_yr} and \Sexpr{end_yr + 1} differences.
%The median difference between \Sexpr{end_yr} and \Sexpr{end_yr + 1}

The probability of the female spawning biomass decreasing from \Sexpr{end_yr} to
\Sexpr{end_yr+1} is above 72\% for all non-zero catch levels examined
(Table~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1} and
Figure~\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-1}). It is 81\% for the
\Sexpr{end_yr} catch level similar to that for \Sexpr{end_yr-1} (catch alternative~f).
%The highest probability of
%decrease is 97\%, which is for the default harvest policy
%(row~g in Table~\ref{tab:es-risk-year-1}).
For all explored catches,
the maximum probability of the female spawning biomass dropping below $B_{10\%}$
at the start of \Sexpr{end_yr+1} is near 0\%,
at the start of \Sexpr{end_yr+2} is 1\%,
and at the start of \Sexpr{end_yr+3} is 4\%
(Tables~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1}--\ref{tab:main-risk-year-3} and
Figures~\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-1}--\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-3}).
The similar maximum probability of dropping below $\Bforty$
at the start of \Sexpr{end_yr+1} is 10\%,
at the start of \Sexpr{end_yr+2} is 24\%,
and at the start of \Sexpr{end_yr+3} is 35\%.
As the large 2010, 2014, and 2016 cohorts continue to age, their biomass is expected to decrease
as losses from mortality continue to outweigh increases from growth.  The
estimated above-average 2020 cohort has already begun to play a large role in determining female spawning
biomass during the forecast years presented here.

It should be noted
that forecasted biomass is not only influenced by catch levels.
As the large 2010 and 2014 cohorts continue to age, their biomass
will continue to decrease (Tables~\ref{tab:main-est-biomass-at-age} and~\ref{tab:main-cohort-effects})
as losses from mortality outweigh increases from growth. The smaller
above-average 2016 cohort entered this growth-mortality transition period around 2019
(Tables~\ref{tab:main-est-biomass-at-age} and~\ref{tab:main-cohort-effects}).
The below-average 2015 and 2018 cohorts will contribute much less to forecasted spawning
biomass than the larger cohorts. During 2023, the age-3 2020 cohort will likely
move through the growth-mortality transition and thus no longer contribute to an
increase in total biomass (note that fecundity will increase which will
influence the exact change in female spawning biomass, Figure~\ref{fig:main-maturity}).
% Already said above:
% The probability
% that the \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[2]} female spawning biomass will be less than the
% \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[1]} female spawning biomass ranges from \Sexpr{f(min(base_model$risks[[1]][,2]))}\% to \Sexpr{f(max(base_model$risks[[1]][,2]))}\%
% depending on the catch level (Table~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1} and
% Figure~\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-1}).


% This needs to be somewhat manual so you can pick the cohorts to
% specify - look at fore.catch.prop and pick the highest and
% put them in order. Comment out un-needed ones.
% Ages and years are now automated.

The age composition (in numbers) of the catch in \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[1]} is
projected to be (using MCMC medians)
\Sexpr{fore.catch.prop$Age3}\% age-3 fish from the \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[1] - 3} cohort,
\Sexpr{fore.catch.prop$Age7}\% age-7 fish from the \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[1] - 7} cohort,
\Sexpr{fore.catch.prop$Age6}\% age-6 fish from the \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[1] - 6} cohort,
\Sexpr{fore.catch.prop$Age9}\% age-9 fish from the \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[1] - 9} cohort,
and only
\Sexpr{fore.catch.prop$Age13}\% age-13 fish from the large \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[1] - 13} cohort
% \Sexpr{fore.catch.prop$Age11}\% age-11 fish from the \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[1] - 11} cohort
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-age-comp-forecast}).
However, those estimates are highly
uncertain with the 95\% credibility interval for the age-3 fraction spanning
\Sexpr{f(fore.catch.prop.age3.lower)}\%--\Sexpr{f(fore.catch.prop.age3.upper)}\%.
%and for the very young and highly uncertain age-2 fraction spanning
%\Sexpr{f(fore.catch.prop.age2.lower)}\%--\Sexpr{f(fore.catch.prop.age2.upper)}\%.

Due to the higher average weight of older fish compared to younger fish, the median expected
proportion of the \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[1]} catch by weight
is \Sexpr{f(fore.catch.prop.wt.age3.median)}\% for the age-3 \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[1] - 3} cohort
(compared to \Sexpr{fore.catch.prop$Age3}\% by numbers)
and \Sexpr{f(fore.catch.prop.wt.age7.median)}\%      % $
for the age-7 \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[1] - 7} cohort
(compared to \Sexpr{fore.catch.prop$Age7}\% by numbers;

With respect to the DFO reference points, with the largest
\Sexpr{assess_yr} catch of \Sexpr{largest.next.catch}~t given in Table~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1},
at the start of \Sexpr{assess_yr+1} the stock is expected to be above the critical zone with a probability of
P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess_yr+1}} > \Bten) =
\Sexpr{prob.next.over.b10}$\%
and in the healthy zone with a probability of
P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess_yr+1}} > \Bforty) =

With respect to the DFO provisional reference points (based on $\Bmsy$),
the stock is expected to be above the provisional critical zone with a

this catch.

%PFMC refrence points for hake/whiting are: Bmsy = 0.4B0; MSST = 0.25B0.  Will report these as well.
With respect to PFMC stock size reference points, a level of \Sexpr{assess_yr} catch consistent with the Agreement
default harvest control rule (\Sexpr{next.treaty.catch}~t) has a

going below $\Bforty$ at the start of \Sexpr{assess_yr + 1} (and

then the probability of the biomass going below $\Bforty$ is

\subsection{Sensitivity analyses }\label{sec:assessment-sensitivity-analyses}

Sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate influence of data inputs and
structural uncertainty of the base model by investigating how changes to the
model affected the estimated values and derived quantities.
All sensitivity analyses
compared MCMC posteriors that were created using the {\tt adnuts} R package
\citep{Monnahan2018, Monnahan2019} to implement the NUTS
algorithm with a similar number of posterior samples as the base model.
Several key underlying structural model assumptions were identified that have
persisted across many previous hake assessments, and thus warrant revisiting
annually as a set of reference sensitivity examinations to new base models.
Many additional sensitivity runs were conducted when developing and testing the
\Sexpr{assess_yr} base model. Here we focus on the main sensitivities which,
relative to the base model, are:

%**update list (and see earlier also I think)

\begin{enumerate}

\item Consideration of higher standard deviations on the prior distribution
  for natural mortality;

\item Consideration of an alternative prior distribution (mean and standard deviation) for natural
  mortality based on the \citet{Hamel2015} and \citet{HamelCope2022} life history meta-analytic method;

\item Consideration of an alternative prior distribution and a fixed value for
  steepness, to change the resiliency of the stock;

\item Assumption of higher and lower variation about the stock-recruitment curve
  ($\sigma_r$);

\item Removal of the age-1 index as a data source;

\item Downweighting the fishery age-composition data; and

\item Consideration of alternative standard deviations for time-varying
  selectivity.

%\item Consideration of an alternative maximum age for fishery and survey
%  selectivity; and

% \item Add the constraint that recruitment deviates must sum to zero.

%\item Removal of cohort-based ageing error from the model; and

\end{enumerate}

%removing this paragraph for 2022, but should be added back in for 2023
%removed because of discrepency in diagnostic plots (not results really) between
%base and sensitivity runs in 2022
%**[have code to create .pdf - can do again this year] The MCMC diagnostics were examined by creating a document
%containing the equivalent of Appendix~\ref{chap:mcmc-diagnostics} for all
%sensitivity analyses (.pdf file available from the JTC upon request). In general,
%diagnostics were similar to those for the base model. Minor differences include:
%sensitivity analyses related to
%$M$ showed more autocorrelation in $M$ and some failed Heidelberger and Welch
%statistics; the Francis reweighting had a lower effective sample size for most
%parameters; lower standard deviations for time-varying selectivity led to a few
%failed Heidelberger and Welch statistics; the analyses with alternative standard
%deviations for time-varying selectivity and the higher maximum age for
%selectivity both yielded lower effective sample sizes; and all three maximum-age-selectivity
%analyses led to a few failed Heidelberger and Welch statistics.

Comparisons of the
parameter estimates between the main sensitivity models with those from the base model are shown
in Tables~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1}--\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-2}.
None of the sensitivities resulted in any substantial departure from
the main population dynamics of the base model. All sensitivity models showed large
estimated increases in female spawning biomass in the early- to mid-2010s that continues to be
driven by the 2010, 2014, and 2016 cohorts, followed by several years of steady decline
(2019--2021) before increasing again due to the strong 2020 cohort.
All sensitivity models indicate that \Sexpr{assess_yr}
relative spawning biomass is above $\Bforty$. The overall scale of the
population was impacted by various alternative assumptions, and the highly
uncertain size of the recent cohorts were more variable across sensitivity analyses
than earlier cohorts which have been observed for more years.

% Leaving as one long line as easier to comment back in if needed (lots of calcs
% in here). May not be needed anyway.
%%The results of this model relative to the base model are shown in Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-2} and Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-2} and \ref{fig:main-recruitment-base-alternative-2}. In general, the estimated population dynamics are similar, regardless of extrapolation, throughout most of the time series.  However, there is some divergence in recent year estimates; e.g., the estimated relative spawning biomass in \Sexpr{end_yr} is \Sexpr{f(100*sens.models.2.for.table[[1]]$derived_quants["Bratio_2016","Value"],1)}\% for the base model (with extrapolation) and \Sexpr{f(100*sens.models.2.for.table[[2]]$derived_quants["Bratio_2016","Value"],1)}\% for the model without extrapolation. The 2016 default harvest control catch limit coming from the base model is \Sexpr{f(sens.models.2.for.table[[1]]$derived_quants["ForeCatch_2016","Value"])}~t compared to \Sexpr{f(sens.models.2.for.table[[2]]$derived_quants["ForeCatch_2016","Value"])}~t for the model using no extrapolation (using MLE values).

% section below on natural mortality sensitivity
The standard deviation of the prior distribution on natural mortality was
increased from the base model value of 0.1 to 0.2 and 0.3. The median of the MCMC posteriors
for natural mortality increased from
\Sexpr{f(nat_m[2], 3)} with a 95\% credible interval
of \Sexpr{f(nat_m[1], 3)}--\Sexpr{f(nat_m[3], 3)} for the base model (prior standard
deviation of 0.1) to \Sexpr{f(nat_m_03[2], 3)} with a 95\% credible interval
of \Sexpr{f(nat_m_03[1], 3)}--\Sexpr{f(nat_m_03[3], 3)}
for the sensitivity run with the prior standard
deviation set to 0.3 (Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1}).
The \citet{HamelCope2022} prior model estimated natural mortality at \Sexpr{f(nat_m_hamel[2], 3)}
with a 95\% credible interval of \Sexpr{f(nat_m_hamel[1], 3)}--\Sexpr{f(nat_m_hamel[3], 3)}
(Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1}).
In addition to allowing a higher estimated value for
natural mortality, these $M$ sensitivity models increased the overall scale of
the population, the estimated stock status relative to $B_0$ prior to 1990, the
uncertainty in female spawning biomass on both absolute and relative scales, halved estimated relative
fishing intensity in \Sexpr{end_yr-1}, and doubled equilibrium yield at $\BSPRforty$
(Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1} and Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-1}
and~\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-1}).

% section below on steepness sensitivity
The mean of the prior distribution on steepness was decreased from 0.777 (base)
to 0.5 and, separately, steepness was fixed at 1.0. The decrease in the mean of the
prior resulted in a decrease in the MCMC estimate of steepness from
a median of \Sexpr{f(steep[2],3)} with a 95\% credible interval
of \Sexpr{f(steep[1], 3)}--\Sexpr{f(steep[3], 3)} to
a median of \Sexpr{f(steep_prior_05[2],3)} with a 95\% credible interval
of \Sexpr{f(steep_prior_05[1], 3)}--\Sexpr{f(steep_prior_05[3], 3)}
(Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1}).
However, neither steepness
sensitivity analysis had a large impact on the overall model results
(Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-1} and
\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-1}), because \fishname\ female spawning biomass has
remained above levels where changes in steepness would appreciably influence
stock-recruit dynamics (Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-sr-variability}).

% section below on sigma_r
The value of $\sigma_r$ was changed from a value of \Sexpr{sigma_r} (base) to
alternative high (\Sexpr{sigma_r_sens[2]}) and low (\Sexpr{sigma_r_sens[1]})
states. Both sensitivities were similar to the base model in that the calculated
standard deviation of recruitment deviations (from the main period) was
higher than the input $\sigma_r$, i.e., \Sexpr{sigma_r_lo_main} and
\Sexpr{sigma_r_hi_main} when $\sigma_r$ was \Sexpr{sigma_r_sens[1]} and
\Sexpr{sigma_r_sens[2]}, respectively. Where, in theory the cacluated standard
deviation should match the input value used for $\sigma_r$.
However, the high $\sigma_r$ model had a
larger difference between the female spawning biomass at unfished equilibrium
and the female spawning biomass at the initial year of the model
than the low $\sigma_r$ model
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-1}).
Similar to previous assessments,
estimates of unfished equilibrium recruitment and relative spawning biomass are sensitive
to $\sigma_r$, whereas absolute estimates of female spawning biomass are
relatively insensitive. The method \citet{MethotTaylor2011} proposed to tune
$\sigma_r$ was developed in the context of maximum likelihood estimation and not
Bayesian inference, where the latter potentially allows for estimating
$\sigma_r$ using random effects, and thus, this proposed method is not
used here to tune the fixed input value.

% Section below on removal of the age-1 index
The sensitivity of the base model to the removal of the age-1 index
provides a comparative evaluation of how the base model incorporates information
about juvenile fish. Compared to the base model, estimates
of female spawning biomass throughout most of the time series are similar, but do
diverge near the end of the time series
(Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1},
Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-2} and
\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-2}). The \Sexpr{end_yr} estimates of
relative spawning biomass are
\Sexpr{f(100*bratio_curr[2], 1)}\%
for the base model (95\% credible interval
of \Sexpr{f(100*bratio_curr[1], 1)}--\Sexpr{f(100*bratio_curr[3], 1)}\%) and
\Sexpr{f(100*bratio_age1[2], 1)}\%
for the removal of the age-1 index model (95\% credible interval
of \Sexpr{f(100*bratio_age1[1], 1)}--\Sexpr{f(100*bratio_age1[3], 1)}\%).
This difference is due to the age-1 index providing additional information on recruitment for cohorts
associated with recent age-1 indices (i.e., 2018 and 2020 cohorts detected in the 2019 and 2021 age-1 indices).
In particular, the base model with the age-1 index suggests that the 2020 year class is estimated to be large,
but not as large as the 2021 and 2022 fishery data alone (i.e., removing the age-1 index) would otherwise
suggest (Figure~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-2}).
%The largest changes are for the most recent years where the model without the index
%has less information about recruitment size.
Removing the age-1 index led to minor changes in fit to the age-2+ survey
biomass index, with
2019 showing a slight improvement and 2021 a deterioration compared to the base
model (Figure~\ref{fig:main-index-base-alternative-2}).

% section below on composition weighting
The base model includes a Dirichlet-multinomial likelihood component,
which uses two estimated parameters to automatically weight each of the fishery and survey age
compositions. The base model was compared to a sensitivity model that downweighted
the fishery age compositions relative to the survey age compositions. The data weighting used
in the sensitivity model was based on the McAllister-Ianelli method.
This method requires manual iterative adjustments to the input sample sizes
using a derived multiplier. The McAllister-Ianelli method, which was used in assessments prior to
2018 (Table~\ref{tab:main-assessment-changes}),
attempts to make the arithmetic mean of the input
sample size approximately equal to the harmonic mean of the effective
sample size. The McAllister-Ianelli method
suggested a weighting factor of 0.14 and 0.46 (ratio of 0.30) for fishery and survey
age compositions, respectively. The median estimate from Dirichlet-multinomial method
used in the base model was \Sexpr{DM.weight.fishery.median} and
\Sexpr{DM.weight.survey.median} (ratio of
\Sexpr{f(as.numeric(DM.weight.fishery.median) /
as.numeric(DM.weight.survey.median),2)}).
Downweighting fishery composition data using the McAllister-Ianelli method
led to minor changes in relative spawning biomass, recruitment estimates, and increased uncertainty
in estimates of early recruitments compared to the base model
(Figures~\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-2} and~\ref{fig:main-recruit-base-alternative-2}).

% section below on selectivity
The degree of flexibility of annual variation in the fishery selectivity was tested using
three sensitivities which set alternative values of the $\Phi$ parameter
(Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-4}-\ref{fig:main-index-base-alternative-4}).
The consideration of alternative standard deviations ($\Phi$) for time-varying
selectivity is discussed earlier in
Section~\ref{sec:data-variability-selectivity}. Changing the values of the
parameter $\Phi$ controlling the flexibility in time-varying selectivity from
the base model value of $\Phi = 1.40$ to alternative values of 0.21, 0.70, and 2.10,
did not appreciably influence the estimates, or precision, associated with recruitment
in 2014, but it did impact more recent recruitments (Figure~\ref{fig:main-recruit-base-alternative-4}).
In particular, recruitment estimates for 2016 and 2020 are linked to the choice of $\Phi$, where the
model with the smallest $\Phi$ (0.21) estimates the 2016 and 2020 recruitment deviation as
the highest of the $\Phi$ sensitivity models (Figure~\ref{fig:main-recruit-devs-base-alternative-4}),
leading to a large increase in female spawning biomass in recent years compared to the base model
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-4}).
The value $\Phi = 0.21$ also provides the worst fit to the most recent
age-2+ survey biomass index
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-index-base-alternative-4}).

%The estimated population trends throughout the time series are similar, irrespective of maximum
%selectivity age (Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-6}-\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-6}).
%The largest differences are in the mid-1980s when age-composition data was sparse, and then again
%over the last few years of the model. Estimates of recruitment were insensitive to the
%choice of maximum age for selectivity, despite the considerable increase in the number of model
%parameters for older maximum ages (Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-2}).  The choice of age-6 as the
%maximum was retained in the base model as it offered more flexibility given historical population structure
%fluctuations and related dynamics than the choice of age-5.
%%All three alternative runs had reduced
%%performance in terms of MCMC diagnostics when compared with the base model.

%Constraining deviations from the stock recruitment relationship (i.e., recruitment deviates)
%to sum to zero across the main recruitment period (an assumption used in pre-2020 stock assessments;
%Table~\ref{tab:main-assessment-changes}; \citealt{JTC2020}), led to a very similar spawning
%biomass trend compared to the base model but increased the estimate of $B_0$ thereby creating
%a downward shift in stock status
%(Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-6}-\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-6}).
%Recruitment estimates were slightly higher and deviations from the stock recruitment relationship
%were ubiquitously slightly more negative than in the base model
%(Figures~\ref{fig:main-recruit-base-alternative-6}-\ref{fig:main-recruit-devs-base-alternative-6}).

% Ageing Error
% Did not run this sensitivity in 2022
%The impact of assuming a time-invariant ageing error vector instead of a
%cohort-based ageing error matrix (as in the base model) was evaluated.  The
%largest changes to model results are associated with estimates of equilibrium
%unfished biomass (Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-3} and
%Figure~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-5}) and thus relative spawning biomass
%(Figure~\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-5}). These differences stem from
%the population model being restricted in the time-invariant case to fitting
%age-composition data with a stationary level of measurement error associated
%with each age. There is very little difference in the current relative biomass between the two,
%with the base model having a median relative biomass of \Sexpr{f(100*depl_curr, 1)}\% and
%the time-invariant ageing error vector model having a median relative biomass of
%\Sexpr{f(100*depl_no_ageerr, 1)}\%. The credible interval is larger for the
%time-invariant ageing error vector model.

%Did not run this sensitivity in 2022
%The impact of using the random walk Metropolis Hastings (rwMH) MCMC algorithm with data inputs
%and model structure equivalent to the base model is shown in
%Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-3} and discussed in further details in
%Appendix~**now-removed.

%An additional sensitivity run arising from the Scientific Review Group
%meeting held from 25th February to 28nd February 2020 related to input sample size is documented
%in Appendix~\ref{chap:srg-requests}.
%Briefly, arbitrarily decreasing the weight of recent fishery age-composition data by taking the square root of the input %sample size led to
%similar estimates of the recent trend in female spawning biomass but differences in
%stock status because of more optimistic estimates of the stock at unfished
%equilibrium. Further responses to other SRG requests are also given in Appendix~\ref{chap:srg-requests}.

\subsection{Retrospective analyses}\label{sec:assessment-retrospective-analyses}

Retrospective analyses were performed by iteratively removing the terminal
years' data (going back 10 years) and estimating the posterior distribution of
parameters under the assumptions of the base
model.
This year's base model shows similar retrospective results to last year's
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-retrospective-recruitment}, \citealt{JTC2022}).
The addition of the age-1 index in last year's base model found estimates
of recruitment
strength to come closer to the long-term stable estimate by age-2 in some cases
compared to the model without the age-1 index \citep{JTC2022}.
However, some cohort recruitments are still over or under-estimated at age-2.
Over-estimation can be seen most clearly with the 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2018
cohorts (Figures~\ref{fig:main-retrospective-recruitment} and~\ref{fig:main-relative-retrospective-recruitment}).
The 2014 cohort
reached a high deviation after two years, then even higher after three years only to drop back down
to a lower value and then stabilize at around age-4 with the addition of more data. A similar pattern
can be seen with the smaller 2017 and 2018 cohorts. Even with the addition of
new data, the size of the very small 2015
cohort has not fully stabilized.
Under-estimation is slight, but apparent, for the 2016 cohort as recruitment estimates have risen
since the estimate at age-3. Cohort strength is further informed once at least
one year of age-2+ survey biomass
index age-composition data are available for a cohort, which for even-numbered
recruitment years typically
does not occur until the cohort reaches age-3, due to the acoustic survey
occurring in odd years; though the age-1 index does provide some information.

The stability of the recruitment estimates seen in this plot is also evident in the uncertainty estimates of
each cohort. Uncertainty of the 2016--2019 cohorts has been substantially reduced compared
to removing five years of data (Figure~\ref{fig:main-biomass-recruitment-retrospective}, bottom figure).
However, the uncertainty of the 2020 cohort has actually increased with the addition of
another year of fishery data compared to last year's base model.
Medians of various quantities of interest are given in Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-retro}.

Overall, there is little retrospective change to the relative spawning biomass
trajectory up to the mid-2010s, and most retrospective change occurs in the
final years of the retrospective model with the most years removed
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-biomass-recruitment-retrospective}).
In this assessment, there is very little retrospective bias, with only
slight year-specific positive and negative bias in female spawning biomass, some minor adjustments to
recruitment deviates, and a slight trend in $B_0$ as the retrospective year increases. All of these
retrospective differences are well within the range of estimation uncertainty across all retrospective years.
There is no indication from retrospective
evaluations that the base model is displaying a systematic bias.

A comparison of the actual assessment models used in each year since
\Sexpr{min(assessment.history$Year, na.rm = TRUE)} is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-assessments}. There have been substantial
differences in the structural assumptions of the models and,
thus, results submitted each year.
The variability between model results, especially early on in the time
series, is larger than the uncertainty (95\% credibility interval) reported from
any single model in recent years.
Prior to 2004, survey catchability was fixed at 1.0 and this assumption was
heavily investigated between 2004 and 2007, leading to variability in model results
because of the use of several different, but fixed, values of survey
catchability. Since 2008, catchability has been freely estimated by the model
($q$ = \Sexpr{base_model$extra.mcmc$Q_vector %>% median() %>% f(2)}).
The fixing of survey catchability had the effect
of driving the estimate of initial biomass upward, which in turn scaled the
entire biomass trajectory up, leading to higher estimates of relative spawning
biomass than in more recent assessments. The median estimates of
female spawning biomass for recent years have remained similar to the previous
assessment but declined relative to the 2015--2017 assessments.
The difference is most likely related to the recent under-fitting of the 2017 survey estimate
of biomass despite the consistency in the structure of the assessment model in
recent years.
In addition to more information about the 2014 and 2016 cohorts, the 2018 assessment model also included
a change in the data weighting method, an update to maturity and fecundity, and a change to selectivity
parameterization (Table~\ref{tab:main-assessment-changes}).
The uncertainty interval associated with the \Sexpr{end_yr} assessment brackets the majority of the
historical estimates.

The level of uncertainty associated with each assessment's estimate of that year's current
female spawning biomass (i.e., that used to convey current stock status and inform management advice)
changes from assessment to assessment given updates in data and \fishname\ population structure and
dynamics. While uncertainty around the absolute amount of 2023 female spawning biomass is the
second largest (behind the 2017 assessment) since 2012, the relative amount of dispersion
(or variability relative to the stock size; similar to a coefficient of variation) is not
inconsistent with previous assessments (Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-dispersion}).

\subsection{Performance of past projections}\label{sec:assessment-past-projections}

Without rigorous simulation experiments
it can be difficult to operationally assess the accuracy of projections in stock
assessments
because the truth is never known with 100\% certainty.
For \fishname, hindsight comparisons have been conducted since 2021 \citep{JTC2021} to evaluate
performance of projections provided in decision tables
(such as Tables~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1} and~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-2})
of past assessments relative to updated assessments.
Overall, results indicate that assessment model projections give
a relatively good idea of general projected trends and status.

% combine_historical_probs(model = base_model, end = assess_yr-1)
% gives the probs if ever want a table

As an example,
the 2019 assessment \citep{JTC2019} gave the estimated probability of the female spawning
biomass declining in the subsequent year, i.e.,~P($B_{2020} < B_{2019}$),
for several possible catches in 2019, such as 0~t, 180,000~t,
350,000~t, 410,000~t etc. Now that we `know' the catch in 2019 was
412,015~t,
% hardwiring to force manually checking if the value changes much from previous assessment
we can select the 410,000~t row (close enough to 412,015~t) in the table from the 2019
assessment to give that assessment's
P$(B_{2020} < B_{2019}) = $\Sexpr{prob.decline.from.2019.to.2020.historic}\%;
Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-1}. We can also calculate this probability
from the current assessment model, which implicitly includes the 412,015~t catch
from 2019, giving
P$(B_{2020} < B_{2019})=$\Sexpr{prob.decline.from.2019.to.2020.curr}\%;
Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-1}.
We extracted similar probabilities
from past assessment documents going back to 2012
and calculate analogous probabilities,
P$(B_{t+1} < B_{t})$, from the current base model
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-1}); see \citet{JTC2022} for full methods.

Each assessment correctly predicted whether the stock would increase or
decrease the following year (except for 2018 and 2021; Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-1}).
Estimates from previous assessments are closer to 50\% than
those from the current base model (except for 2021; Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-1}),
because the current assessment model has more information and thus provides a more
definitive probability (closer to 0\% or to 100\%) than year $t$'s
assessment model. It is desirable that the probabilities from the assessment
documents are not too definitive (too close to 0\% or to 100\%), because they are
admitting a wide range of uncertainty given unknown recent recruitments.

% I think we could cut this as it is an example of what is already describe above
%The historical probability of P$(B_{2013} < B_{2012}) = $\Sexpr{prob.decline.from.2012.to.2013.historic}\%
%from the 2012 assessment is
%quite a lot higher than the \Sexpr{prob.decline.from.2012.to.2013.curr}\% calculated using the current assessment model
%(Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-1}). But this makes sense because the
%2012 assessment model had no information that the 2010 recruitment was going to be very large
%(it did not include the age-1 index, which in 2011 did indicate a large 2010 recruitment,
%Figure~\ref{fig:main-age-one-index}).
%However, the current base model does have such information from many years of age
%data. Hence, the current model confidently `expects' a large increase in female spawning biomass
%from 2012 to 2013 as the individuals in the 2010 cohort grew in size. The 2013
%assessment model had some information on the 2010 cohort, so the lower estimated
%probability that the stock would decline from 2013 to 2014 better concurs with
%the current base model than results from the 2012 assessment
%(Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-1}).

The 2018 and 2021 assessments `incorrectly' projected the stock would likely
decline the following year (given the catch that subsequently occurred), because
the current assessment model estimates a likely increase (Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-1}).
In 2018, this occurred because the biomass trend was relatively flat
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-female-spawning-biomass}) so even slight changes in biomass could influence
binomial outcomes of an `increase' or `decrease' in biomass, despite the
overall change in biomass not being very substantial.
The 2021 assessment \citep{JTC2021} had no information on the 2020 cohort and predicted the
biomass would probably decline in 2022 even with zero catch in 2021. However, the current
assessment estimates that the 2020 cohort was particularly large, which highlights how impactful
a realized large deviation from average recruitment (rather than assuming
average recruitment) can be on
forecasted outcomes.
Similarly, the 2012 assessment had no information on the very large 2010
recruitment, and so also over-estimated the probability of decline the following
year (Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-1}).
% and that its total biomass increased by
%1.4~million~t from 2021 to 2022 (Table~\ref{tab:main-est-biomass-at-age}), whereas for an average cohort such as
%2017 (Figure~\ref{fig:main-recruitment}) the biomass would increase from age-1
%to age-2 by around 70~thousand~t
%(Table~\ref{tab:main-est-biomass-at-age}). Since the 2021 assessment would have
%assumed average 2020 recruitment (and also the 2019 recruitment appeared small) it
%was expecting that the female spawning biomass would probably decline.

A range of catch alternatives are shown for the current assessment because
realized \Sexpr{assess_yr} catches are not yet known (Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-1}).
Catching zero fish in \Sexpr{assess_yr} gives
the lowest probability that the stock will decline from \Sexpr{assess_yr} to
\Sexpr{assess_yr+1}, with any realistic \Sexpr{assess_yr} catch leading to a
likely decline in female spawning biomass given current information.

A similar approach was used to calculate the
probability of the biomass falling below
$\Bforty$ in the subsequent year,
i.e.,~P$(B_{t+1} < \Bforty)$; Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-2}.
The 2012 assessment was the only one that gave a $>50\%$ chance of the biomass falling below
$\Bforty$ in the subsequent year, but later data determined that the 2010 year class was indeed
substantial and so in hindsight the probability of going below $\Bforty$ was 0\%
(based on the current assessment).
%The 2013--2017 assessments had information on the 2010 year class
%and so estimated low probabilities of falling below $\Bforty$. Again, these
%estimates are closer to 50\% than those from the current base model (blue dots),
%which is desirable behavior as mentioned above -- the assessments gave low
%probabilities of an unlikely event occurring that we now believe to have been even more
%unlikely to have occurred.
Since the 2018 assessment, the estimated probabilities
of the biomass falling below $\Bforty$ were $>10\%$ and
continued to rise (Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-2}), until falling due to the
incoming 2020 cohort. Note that the biomass has been relatively high during the time period shown,
so `correctly expecting' the biomass to remain $>\Bforty$ may not be a particular high bar to
attain.

%Overall, these results suggest that assessment model projections give
%a relatively good idea of general trends and status.
%Past projections of increases
%or decreases in the stock or in the biomass not going below $\Bforty$ the following year, have almost always been `correct' (the most
%probable direction has agreed with the latest base model and data).

Retrospective versions of Figures~\ref{fig:main-historical-1}
and~\ref{fig:main-historical-2} are calculated using the
current base model but with data only up to a certain year (Figures~\ref{fig:main-historical-retro-1}--\ref{fig:main-historical-retro-bforty-all}).
While there are some minor exceptions, the retrospective probabilities of decline
(colored squares in
Figures~\ref{fig:main-historical-retro-1}--\ref{fig:main-historical-retro-all}) are
generally close to the probabilities currently estimated using all available
data (blue triangles).
An exception is P$(B_{2016} < B_{2015})$ which is underestimated (compared to
the current base model) until data to 2017 are included (the 2015 values in each panel of
Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-retro-2}).
This is due to the retrospective uncertainty
of the 2014 cohort, seen as an increase and then decrease in expected cohort
size in Figure~\ref{fig:main-retrospective-recruitment}.
The retrospective calculations for P$(B_{t+1} < \Bforty)$ show little change as
more data are added (Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-retro-bforty-all}), except
for 2015 and 2021 as information becomes available about the strong 2014 and
2020 cohorts. Combined, these results enhance confidence in the projected
outcomes from the assessment model.

%This text below is all very hard and intracite to follow, so tried to briefly summarize above
%Exceptions include during the relatively flat female spawning biomass trajectory from
%2018--2020 (see above). As expected, the estimate of P$(B_{2022} < B_{2021})$ gets closer to
%the current assessment's estimate with the information provided by the age-1
%index (2021 values of green square in bottom panel of Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-retro-3}
%and grey square in Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-retro-4}).
%A further exception is that
%P$(B_{2016} < B_{2015})$ is close to the current base model's value when using
%data up to 2014 (the dark grey square and blue squares at 2015 are close together in the
%bottom panel of Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-retro-1}). Yet, when the 2015 data
%are included, the probability falls noticeably (the gold square at 2014 in the top panel of
%Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-retro-2}). It falls further when the 2016 data
%are included (the orange square at 2014 in the middle panel of
%Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-retro-2}), finally agreeing with the current base
%model when the 2017 data are included (the pink square at 2014 in the bottom panel of
%Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-retro-2}). This is presumably explained by the
%retrospective analysis of recruitment deviations of the large 2014 cohort. The
%2014 cohort is
%overestimated (compared to current estimates) when including data up to 2015 and
%2016 (the highest two green points for the 2014 cohort in
%Figure~\ref{fig:main-retrospective-recruitment}), but then is more consistently
%estimated once the 2017 data are included (note that 2017 was a survey
%year). This further emphasises how the assessment model requires a few years of
%data to estimate recruitments.

%The retrospective calculations for P$(B_{t+1} < \Bforty)$ show little change as
%more data are added (Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-retro-bforty-all}), except
%for 2015 and 2021 as information becomes available about the strong 2014 and
%2020 cohorts.
