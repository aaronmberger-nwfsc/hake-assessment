\section{ASSESSMENT}\label{sec:assessment}

\subsection{Modeling history}\label{sec:assessment-modeling-history}

In spite of the relatively short history of fishing, \fishname\ have surely been
subject to a larger number of stock assessments than any marine species off the
west coast of the U.S.~and Canada. These assessments have included a large
variety of age-structured models. Initially, a cohort analysis tuned to fishery
CPUE was used \citep{FrancisSwartzmanEtAl1982}. Later, the cohort analysis was
tuned to NMFS triennial acoustic survey estimates of absolute abundance at age
\citep{HollowedAdlersteinEtAl1988}. Since 1989, stock-synthesis models using
fishery catch-at-age data and acoustic survey estimates of population biomass
and age composition have been the primary assessment method
\citep{JTC2019}.

While the general form of the age-structured assessment has remained similar since 1991,
management procedures have been modified in a variety of ways. There have been
alternative data choices, post-data collection processing routines, different
data-weighting schemes, many structural assumptions for the stock
assessment model, and alternative control rules. Table~\ref{tab:main-assessment-changes}
summarises the major changes to the model structure in assessments since 2011.

Data processing, choices, and weighting have been modified several times in
historical hake assessments. For example, acoustic data processing has been
modified over the years through modifications to target strength calculations
\citep{DornSaunders1997} or the introduction of kriging
\citep{StewartHamel2010}. While survey data have been the key index for
abundance since 1988, surveys that have been used have varied considerably. The
AFSC/NWFSC triennial bottom trawl survey was used from 1988 before being
discarded from the 2009 assessment (by \citealt{HamelStewart2009}). Acoustic
surveys from the years prior to 1995 were used for assessments in the early
1990s, but \citet{StewartForrestEtAl2011} reviewed these early surveys and
deemed that sampling had been insufficient to be comparable with more
recent data. Various recruitment indices have also been considered, but subsequently
rejected \citep{HelserDornEtAl2002, HelserFleischerEtAl2005,
StewartHamel2010}. Even where data have been consistently used, the weighting of these data
in the statistical likelihood has changed through the use of various emphasis factors
(e.g., \citealt{Dorn1994, DornSaundersEtAl1999}), a multinomial sample
size on age compositions (e.g., \citealt{DornSaundersEtAl1999, HelserDornEtAl2002,
HelserFleischerEtAl2005, StewartForrestEtAl2011}),
internal estimations of effective sample size using the
Dirichlet-Multinomial distribution \citep{JTC2018},
and assumptions regarding year-specific
survey variance. The list of changes discussed above is for illustrative
purposes only; it is only a small fraction of the different data choices
analysts have made and that reviewers have required.

**mention 2019 changes somewhere.

The structure of assessment models has perhaps had the largest number of
changes. In terms of spatial models, analysts have considered
spatially explicit forms \citep{Dorn1994, Dorn1997}, spatially implicit forms
\citep{HelserStewartEtAl2006} and single-area models \citep{JTC2012}. Predicted
recruitment has been modeled by sampling historical recruitment (e.g.,
\citealt{Dorn1994, HelserFleischerEtAl2005}), using a stock-recruitment
relationship parameterized using maximum sustainable yield ($\text{MSY}$) and
the fishing mortality rate estimated to produce the MSY ($\Fmsy$; \citealt{Martell2010}),
and using several alternative steepness priors \citep{JTC2012,
JTC2013}. Selectivity has also been modeled in several ways,
invariant \citep{JTC2012, JTC2013}, time-varying with \citep{HelserDornEtAl2002}
and without \citep{Dorn1994, DornSaunders1997, JTC2012, JTC2013} a random walk and
alternative levels of allowable deviation through time \citep{JTC2013, JTC2017},
age-based \citep{Dorn1994, DornSaunders1997, JTC2012, JTC2013}, and length-based
\citep{HelserMartell2007}.

Several harvest control rules have been explored for providing catch limits from
these stock assessments. \fishname\ stock assessments have presented decision
makers with constant $F$, variable $F$, and the following hybrid control rules:
$F_{\text{SPR}=35\%}$, $\Fforty$, \Ffortyten, $F_{\text{SPR}=45\%}$,
$F_{\text{SPR}=45\%}$--40:10, and $F_{\text{SPR}=50\%}$ (e.g., \citealt{Dorn1996,
JTC2013}). The above is only a small fraction of the number of management
procedures that have actually been investigated. There have been many other
combinations of data, assessment models, and harvest control rules. In addition
to the cases examined in the assessment documents, there have been many more
requested at review panel meetings.

While there have been many changes to \fishname\ management procedures, each one
has been considered carefully. Available data have changed over the years, and there
have been many advances in the discipline of fisheries science. In some ways,
the latter has evolved considerably over the course of the historical hake
fishery: new statistical techniques and software have evolved (e.g., Bayesian
vs.~maximum likelihood methods), and the scientific literature has
suggested potentially important biological dynamics to consider (e.g., explicit
modeling of length-at-age). Policies requiring the application of
specific control rules have also changed such as the United States' National
Standards Guidelines in 2002 and the \Ffortyten{} harvest control rule
in the Agreement
(see Glossary in Appendix~\ref{chap:glossary}). Analysts making changes to \fishname\ management procedures have been
trying to improve the caliber and relevance of the assessments by responding to
new scientific developments, policy requirements, and different or new insights
during the peer review process. Until the process for a MSE
began, initiated in 2013 \citep{JTC2013} and currently being revisited,
none of these management procedure changes were evaluated by simulation and
quantitatively compared with performance measures.

\subsection{Description of base model}\label{sec:assessment-base-model}

**The \Sexpr{assess.yr} base model is predominantly an update of the base model in
the \Sexpr{last.assess.yr} stock assessment.
The statistical-catch-at-age model assumes that the
\fishname\ population is a single coast-wide stock subject to
one aggregated fleet with combined male and female population dynamics.
**[mention what was used in 2018] Stock Synthesis
\citep{MethotWetzel2013} version \Sexpr{ss.version} is again used,
having been introduced in the previous assessment \citep{JTC2018}.
The largest changes between the
\Sexpr{last.assess.yr} and \Sexpr{assess.yr} stock assessments are **the addition of another
year of
acoustic survey and
fishery data and the **switch from time-invariant to year-specific values for
fecundity.**other changes.

**The \Sexpr{assess.yr} base model includes an acoustic data time series from 1995
to \Sexpr{last.survey.year}. The updated maturity ogive from 2018 was retained
(see Section~\ref{sec:data-maturity}). The Dirichlet-Multinomial (D-M)
likelihood approach \citep{ThorsonEtAl2017Dirichlet} was again used to estimate the weights
associated with age-composition data, rather than iteratively tuning the sample size multiplier
as in 2017 and earlier assessments (see
Section~\ref{sec:data-age-comp-likelihood}). Time-varying fishery
selectivity is retained in the \Sexpr{assess.yr} base model with the magnitude
of the allowable deviations unchanged from the \Sexpr{last.assess.yr} base model
(see Section~\ref{sec:data-variability-selectivity}).
The general parameterization of
selectivity was retained, although additional parameters were required to
estimate an additional year of deviations. The acoustic survey selectivity is
assumed to not change over time. Selectivity curves were modeled as
non-parametric functions estimating age-specific values for each age beginning
at age-2 for the acoustic survey (because age-1 fish are mainly excluded from
the sampling design) and age-1 for the fishery until a maximum age of 6 (all
fish 6 and older have the same selectivity).

**Prior probability distributions remained unchanged from \Sexpr{last.assess.yr}
and fixed values are used for several parameters. For the base model, the
instantaneous rate of natural mortality ($M$) is estimated with a
\Sexpr{m.prior[1]} prior having a median of \Sexpr{m.prior[2]} and a standard
deviation (in log-space) of 0.1 (see
Section~\ref{sec:data-natural-mortality}). The stock-recruitment function is a
Beverton-Holt parameterization, with the log of the mean unexploited recruitment
freely estimated. This assessment uses the same Beta-distributed prior for
stock-recruit steepness ($h$), based on \citet{MyersBowenEtAl1999}, that has
been applied since 2011 \citep{StewartForrestEtAl2011, JTC2012, JTC2013,
JTC2014, JTC2015, JTC2016, JTC2017, JTC2018}. Year-specific recruitment deviations were estimated
from 1966--2018 as well as the years \Sexpr{assess.yr}, \Sexpr{assess.yr+1}, and
\Sexpr{assess.yr+2} for purposes of forecasting. The standard deviation,
$\sigma_r$, of recruitment variability, serving as both a recruitment deviation
constraint and bias-correction term, is fixed at a value of
\Sexpr{base.model$sigma_R_in} in this assessment. This value is based on
consistency with the observed variability in the time series of recruitment
deviation estimates, and is the same as assumed in assessments from 2013 to
\Sexpr{last.assess.yr} (Table~\ref{tab:main-assessment-changes}). Survey
catchability was set at the median unbiased estimate calculated analytically as
per \citet{LudwigWalters1981}. Maturity is assumed to be time-invariant.
Fecundity is defined as weight-at-age multiplied by the maturity ogive
and is time-varying across years with empirical weight-at-age data (1975--
\Sexpr{last.data.yr}).  For years without data, prior to 1975 and during the forecast
period, fecundity is calculated using the long-term mean weight-at-age (see
Section~\ref{sec:assessment-response-review} for more details). Alternative
fecundity assumptions are presented through sensitivity analyses
(Section~\ref{sec:assessment-sensitivity-analyses}).

**Statistical likelihood functions used for data fitting are typical of many stock
assessments. The acoustic survey index of abundance was fit via a log-normal
likelihood function, using the observed (and extra 2009) sampling variability,
estimated via kriging, as year-specific weighting. An additional constant and
additive standard deviation on the log-scale component is included, which was
freely estimated to accommodate unaccounted-for sources of process and
observation error. A Dirichlet-Multinomial (D-M) likelihood was applied to age-composition data,
with input sample sizes equal to the sum of the number of trips or hauls actually sampled across all
fishing fleets or the number of trawl sets in the research surveys (see Section~\ref{sec:data-age-comp-likelihood}).
A weighting parameter for the fishery
and the survey age compositions was specified and then estimated in the model fitting procedure
to allow for additional sources of process and observation error. This process resulted in
automatically tuned input sample sizes.  Tuning quantities did not change in assessments from 2012 to
2015, however additional tuning was required in 2016 and 2017 given the
updated acoustic survey index composition data and refinements to fishery
composition data. Tuning quantities changed again in 2018 with the addition of the
new D-M data weighting (tuning) approach.  Tuning quantities remained relatively
consistent from 2018 to \Sexpr{assess.yr}.

Uncertainty of estimated quantities was calculated via Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) simulations. The bounds of 95\% credibility intervals were calculated as
the 2.5\% quantile and the 97.5\% quantile of posterior distributions from the
MCMC simulations, to give equal-tailed intervals. The Stock Synthesis input
files for the base model are given in
Appendices~\ref{chap:data-file}-\ref{chap:weight-at-age-file}.

**Calculations and figures from Stock Synthesis output were performed using
\Sexpr{R.Version()$version.string} \citep{R2019} and many R packages (in
particular r4ss and xtable). The use of R, knitr, \LaTeX~and GitHub immensely
facilitated the collaborative writing of this document.
In particular, having most of the code automatically shared since the 2016
assessment \citep{JTC2016} allowed the Canadian JTC members to conduct
a preliminary assessment (without
the 2018 age data) during the U.S. government shutdown, and ensured the
JTC could complete a full assessment in the limited time available.
A recent DFO workshop \citep{EdwardsDupliseaEtAl2018} shared such a
`transparent, traceable and transferable' workflow with a wider audience,
partly motivated by our ongoing \fishname\ assessments.

\subsection{**Response to 2018 Scientific Review Group (SRG) review}\label{sec:assessment-response-review}

**Update whole section using usual formatting.

The Scientific Review Group (SRG) meeting was held from February 26 to March 2, 2018
at the Lynnwood Convention Center, Lynnwood, WA, USA.

The following are the `Assessment Recommendations and Conclusions' from the 2018
SRG report, and associated responses from the JTC:

1. The stock assessment results and stock status are highly sensitive to two aspects of the
model:

(i) \underline{Weights-at-age}: Maturity-at-age was recalculated in the 2018 assessment
based on an analysis of ovaries collected during the fishery and survey in
recent years to produce an empirical vector of the proportion mature (i.e., that
will likely spawn) at each age.  Spawning biomass in the base-case model is
calculated as the product of numbers-at-age, maturity-at-age, and mean
weight-at-age (averaged over all years 1975-2017). The SRG noted that this
approach ignores the conspicuous pattern of weights-at-age being much higher in
the late 1970s than in recent years. Although the base-case model accounts for
this pattern by using annual weights-at-age when calculating total biomass and
catches, the variability and pattern in weight-at-age are not included in the
calculation of fecundity-at-age and spawning biomass. The SRG considers it more
appropriate to calculate spawning biomass using annual weights-at-age for years
with data, especially given the higher weights-at-age in the 1970s, and
requested a sensitivity to explore the influence of this decision. To conduct
this sensitivity an assumption was made that for calculating spawning biomass in
2018 and future projections, average weight-at-age in the most recent 3 years of
data be used; and for calculating spawning biomass in the unfished state and
years before 1975, the average weight-at-age in the first 5 years of data
(1975-1979) be used. [The alternative model maintained the base model's approach
for estimating total biomass prior to 1975 and also in projections (using the
weights-at-age averaged over 1975 to 2017). The SRG has requested that the JTC
apply calculations for these periods consistent with decisions taken at this
meeting when it reports back at the 2019 SRG meeting.] Three hypotheses that
might explain the observed changes in weights-at-age: density-dependent growth,
environmental drivers, and fishing-induced evolution. {\bf The SRG requests that the
JTC examine the historical weights-at-age data, evaluate approaches for
parameterizing fecundity-at-age for years without data (pre-1975), and evaluate
other methods of deriving biological reference points such as $B_0$}.

\emph{Response -- The JTC agreed with the SRG recommendation to calculate spawning
biomass and fecundity using annual weight-at-age for years with data, and accordingly included
time-varying fecundity in the 2019 base model. Thus, fecundity
(calculated as weight-at-age multiplied by maturity) changed from being defined by a
single catch-weighted average of weight-at-age applied to all years to being defined
by year-specific weight-at-ages covering the time period with data (1975--2018).
For periods without data (pre-1975 and post-2018), catch-weighted average weight-at-age was used
in the base model. This configuration was based on results from several investigations
outlined in the following paragraphs. Alternative fecundity configurations (and thus weight-at-age)
for the pre-1975 and forecast period were also used in sensitivity runs
(see Sections~\ref{sec:assessment-fecundity-recap} and~\ref{sec:assessment-sensitivity-fecundity}).}

\emph{Historical weight-at-age data was re-examined to ensure that all relevant data
were available to the assessment. Samples from the 1960s in PacFIN
that were used in analyses by Christine Stawitz were found to be from Puget Sound, and
were therefore correctly excluded from previous (and the current) hake assessments. Weight data
from early years was identified as possibly suspect due to inaccurate scales used at that time,
especially on foreign vessels.  However, a comparison of mean weight-at-age with mean length-at-age
showed that those age/year bins with high mean weight also had high mean length, and the method of
length measurement likely hasn't changed considerably over time. Ages from the earlier years were likely
solely based on surface reads, whereas protocol since the early 2000s has been to use the break and burn
method on fish older than about age-2.  A comparison between ageing methods was
done recently for Petrale Sole, indicating
increased bias as fish age when using surface reads, although no such analysis that
we are aware of has been done for \fishname. If otoliths from the early years were properly preserved
and stored, there may be a chance to conduct research to enumerate any potential biases.
Other than standard data updates and the addition of historic weight-at-age data from Canadian
fishery and surveys (see Section~\ref{sec:data-weight-at-age}), no changes were made to
weight-at-age data based on these considerations.}

\emph{Regarding the assumption of pre-1975 weight-at-ages, the JTC conducted an analysis
to see whether there was any indication that weights-at-age values were trending through
time. A weighted least squares approach was used to fit log weight (kg) data across years 1975-2018,
where a separate analysis was done for each age group (age-2 through age-15) and
weights were defined as the inverse of the annual sample variance. The resulting
slope parameter was used to better understand age-specific long-term trends in
weight-at-age. The results of this analysis showed a near zero slope for all ages,
with age-13, 14, and 15 being slightly positive and all others being slightly negative
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-empirical.weight.at.age.years}), which was not unexpected
given the large amount of inter-annual variability
in the data. However, estimated slope parameters were sensitive to excluding data from
1975--1980. This, together with the lack of a clear trend of weights-at-age
through time, led us to use in the base model the long-term mean (1975--2018) weights-at-age
(rather than the short term from 1975--1979) for
the pre-1975 time period.
Overall inferences were similar when using length instead of weight.}

\emph{Furthermore, there were small numbers of age samples for the early years (especially 1975)
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:main-empirical.weight.at.age.numbers}. The few heavy fish in the 15-year-old and older
accumulator group from 1976--1979 influence the short-term average for 1975--1979 time period,
further justifying use of the long-term mean (1975--2018) for the pre-1975 time period.
See Sections~\ref{sec:assessment-fecundity-recap}
and~\ref{sec:assessment-sensitivity-fecundity} for further details.
and sensitivity runs that explore these assumptions.}

\emph{Regarding forecast year weight-at-ages, the JTC used the weighted
least squares analysis to also suggest that the assumption of using the long-term
mean for weight-at-age in 2019--2021 was reasonable. As documented last year
(page~23 of \citealt{JTC2018}), the current configuration of Stock Synthesis
(version 3.30.10 as used for this assessment) precludes properly testing other
assumptions while using the final year of empirical weight-at-age data.
The software required forecast year weights-at-age values
to be either (i)~set to the same as that for equilibrium conditions, or (ii)~set
equivalent to the final year of data (2018).  For example, we were unable to set
future weight-at-age values to be the mean of 2016-2018 without also setting
the 2018 weights-at-age to that mean (thereby averaging out the 2018 data).
Therefore, we retained the 2018 base model assumption of using the overall
1975-2018 mean for the forecast period. See Section~\ref{sec:assessment-fecundity-recap}
for further details.}
% On 4 February 2019, the JTC learned that
% the newest version of Stock Synthesis (version 3.30.12) now allows independent
% forecast period settings for time-varying parameters or inputs.  Alternative
% forecast settings can be explored in future assessments.  In response to this finding,
% the JTC verified that using either a recent 3-year (2016--2018) or a 5-year (2014--2018)
% average weight-at-age vector in the forecast period made little difference in
% 2019--2021 stock status. This was expected because weight-at-age values in recent
% years have been similar to the long-term average.}

\emph{During the 2018 SRG meeting it was further realized that (p23 of \citealt{JTC2018})
``An inconsistency
in this alternative run is that the mean weight-at-age
across all years is still used for the calculation of
\emph{stock biomass} in the years outside the range with empirical data (1975-2017),
rather than the short-term averages (1975-1979 or 2015-2017). A brief examination of
the sensitivity of the alternative run to removing this inconsistency showed
relatively little change in results.''  This inconsistency has been resolved
and does not affect the 2019 base model or sensitivity runs.}

\emph{Several alternative weight-at-age (and time-varying fecundity) data configurations
were examined through sensitivity analyses.  These include (i)~time invariant
fecundity, (ii)~alternative pre-1975 settings, and (iii)~ alternative forecast period
settings.  See Section~\ref{sec:assessment-sensitivity-analyses} for further
description and results from sensitivity runs.}

\emph{Regarding evaluating other methods of deriving biological reference points
such as $B_0$, the JTC expresses interest in using the developing Management
Strategy Evaluation to test the impact of making different assumptions about
calculating $B_0$, and other reference points, in the presence of variability
in weight-at-age. For example, what if there has been a long-term decline in
weight-at-age but it is ignored when setting reference points, or what if
weight-at-age varies randomly through time but reference points are set using
a non-representative subset of the long-term trend?  Recent simulation work by \citet{Berger2018},
using \fishname\ as one example, provided evidence that static reference points, such
as those based on unfished equilibrium conditions ($B_0$), can be misleading when there are
directional trends or regime shift changes in the underlying stock productivity.}


(ii) \underline{Variance in recruitment deviations ($\sigma_R$)}:
The SRG notes the high sensitivity of the
model to the variance parameter assumed for recruitment deviations ($\sigma_R$, a
parameter that is not directly observable). While the spawning biomass trajectories across
values of $\sigma_R$ were very close to one another, the corresponding estimates of $R_0$ led
to widely different estimates of stock status (relative spawning biomass). The JTC
presented evidence that supported the value used in the assessment. {\bf The SRG
encourages the JTC to explore methods for parameterizing recruitment and/or
estimating $\sigma_R$ that would reduce model sensitivity to the value of this
constraint}.

% From Issue \#468:
\emph{Response -- Developing best practices for modeling recruitment variability ($\sigma_R$)
  remains a broad topic of contemporary research.  The JTC has outlined several
  alternative approaches for advancing this research as it applies to \fishname.
  These are:
  (a) estimating $\sigma_R$ in MCMC runs while testing semi-parametric selectivity;
  (b) estimating recruitment autocorrelation to examine the impact it has on the model
  and whether it reduces sensitivity to the choice of $\sigma_R$;
  (c) use the Template Model Builder (TMB)
  code developed by Nis Jacobsen for the Management Strategy Evaluation to explore
  random effects treatment of recruitment variability \citep{Thorson2018}.
  The JTC plans to continue to work towards evaluating and testing best practices
  for modeling recruitment variability.  Progression on these research topics was
  halted during the 2019 assessment season due to unforeseen time constraints imposed
  on the JTC.}

2. The SRG notes that when setting values for other parameters that cannot be estimated
directly with confidence, the choice of values should be made using methods that are
objective, repeatable, and depend on fits to the observed data rather than on the model's
subsequent estimates of biomass or recruitment. One clear example is setting the parameter
controlling time-varying fishery selectivity ($\Phi$), with a goal of establishing repeatable steps
for setting $\Phi$ each year. The SRG recommends that the JTC provide a review of how
time-varying selectivity is parameterized and estimated in other assessments.

\emph{Response -- Although some progress has been made identifying other assessments that specify
the variability associated with time-varying selectivity ($\Phi$), a thorough review and comparison
of alternative approaches could not be completed in time for the 2019 assessment due to unforeseen
time constraints this assessment season.}


3. After reviewing the sensitivity analysis for minor corrections to the catch series, the SRG
agrees that the assessment results were not significantly affected. {\bf However, the coding and
database errors should be rectified as soon as possible.}

\emph{Response -- These issues were largely rectified during the 2018 meeting, while
remaining issues have since been permanently fixed.}


4. The new histological analysis of ovaries for maturity, like previous analyses, showed a
distinct difference in the percent of hake that are mature at age 2 and age 3 between areas,
with a greater proportion mature south of Point Conception (34.47$^\circ$N). These data suggest
that there may be two populations of hake, north and south of this boundary. The SRG also
notes that ovaries collected in Canada were not used to update the maturity ogive. The hake
found in Canada are generally older age fish and including samples of these fish in the
maturity analysis should improve the robustness of the maturity ogive. {\bf The SRG strongly
supports the planned genetic analyses to determine whether there are also genetic
differences between these two southern regions and other regions as well. In addition,
the SRG notes that Canadian samples should be included in the maturity analysis.}

\emph{Response -- Regarding genetic difference between regions, Krista Nichols
  (NWFSC, NOAA) and her staff have started working on this. She says
  ``NWFSC staff have begun a genetic analysis using hake samples collected along
  the Pacific coast during summer, fall (British Columbia to California) and winter
  (Oregon and California) and
  within the Strait of Georgia (British Columbia) during the spring. Prior genetic analyses in
  Pacific Hake have focused on a smaller geographic range, over a limited seasonal
  time scale, and used a limited set of genetic markers \citep{IwamotoFordEtAl2004,
  iwamoto2015microsatellite}. To improve the power to evaluate genetic stock
  structure and associations with life history characters important for
  assessment, thousands of genetic markers in hake are being surveyed using
  genomic technologies \citep{baird2008rapid, ali2016rad}. Initial genetics data
  have been generated for 400 individuals, with planned genetic analysis of close
  to 2,000 individuals total. This study will examine genetic connectivity between
  geographic and temporal collections, and evaluate the hypothesis that offshore
  hake migrate seasonally to Baja and California for spawning in the winter. This
  work began in December 2018 and is expected to be completed in 2020.}

\emph{Regarding including the Canadian samples in the maturity analysis, DFO is
  continuing to assess workload logistics, including the possibility of getting trained by Melissa
  Head (NWFSC) on the histological methods she used in the recent maturity analysis or
  alternatively getting samples sent from Canada to Seattle, if appropriate.
  Presumably, the 2019 survey or fishery would be the earliest time to get any additional
  Canadian samples.}

5. The 2018 assessment diverged from past practice in its approach to determining the data
weights applied to the age-composition data. Past assessments used an iterative approach
(sometimes referred to as the McAllister-Ianelli approach) to arrive at these weightings. The
2018 assessment incorporates the weightings as estimable parameters, thereby eliminating
the need for iterative reweighting. This streamlines the assessment process and the SRG
considers it to be a sensible and useful improvement. {\bf However, the SRG requests that the
JTC provide thorough documentation of all changes in methods of data weighting.}

\emph{Response -- Section~\ref{sec:data-age-comp-likelihood}
includes information on all methods,
current and historical, used to weight composition data. Additionally,
Table~\ref{tab:main-assessment-changes} includes a time series of
weights used for the fishery and survey age compositions as well
as a comparable value derived from the current model that uses the
Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood to estimate weights.}

6. The issue of data weighting remains a significant technical challenge for stock assessments
(such as the Pacific hake assessment) that integrate information of different forms (e.g.,
biomass indices and age compositions) from different sources (e.g., different fishing sectors).
The SRG notes that the JTC has considered alternative schemes for data weighting such as
the Francis (2011) method. {\bf The SRG notes that it would be useful for such explorations
to be documented in future assessment reports, and requests that JTC perform a
sensitivity analysis for this method in future assessments.}

\emph{Response -- Sensitivity analyses were included to compare the
use of the Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood to the McAllister-Ianelli and
Francis weighting methods
(see Section~\ref{sec:assessment-sensitivity-analyses}).
All three methods are described in
Section~\ref{sec:data-age-comp-likelihood} and historical weightings used in
previous assessments can be compared to values estimated in this assessment
(Table~\ref{tab:main-assessment-changes}).}

A potential issue related to data weighting that should be explored in the next assessment is
the JTC's approach to deriving the initial set of data weightings associated with the fishery
and survey age-composition observations. Table 5 in the assessment document shows the
annual number of at-sea hauls and shore-based trips from which fish ages were incorporated
into the age-composition series and the document states that ``initial sample sizes are simply
the summed hauls and trips''. If there are changes in the number of fish associated with each
sample unit (haul or trip) over time, one would expect a corresponding change in the
information content of an age-composition sample. For example, there may have been more
fish per sample in early years than later years, implying that the assessment model should
provide a better fit to early samples than to later samples. The approach taken to deriving the
initial data weights could account for changes in the number of fish per sampling unit.
Alternatively, the Dirichlet multinomial parameter that accounts for variability in the age-
composition observations could include a time-varying component to account for changes in
the number of fish per sampling unit. {\bf The SRG recommends that the JTC include
information in the next assessment on the annual numbers of fish underlying each
annual age-composition observation and present an analysis of the potential influence
of changes in sampling.}

\emph{Response -- The number of age (and weight) samples used to develop age
compositions over time (1975--2018) are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:main-empirical.weight.at.age.numbers}.
A formal evaluation of the influence temporal fluctuations in the number of fish
sampled and aged has on model performance could not be completed in time for the 2019 assessment
due to unforeseen time constraints during the assessment season.  The JTC plans to complete
such an evaluation in preparation for the 2020 stock assessment.}

7. {\bf The SRG requests that the estimates of total age-2$+$ biomass be included in Table 18 of
the assessment report in the future.}

\emph{Response -- This was done for the published version of the 2018
  assessment, and will be the standard for the 2019 assessment and beyond.}

8. {\bf The SRG recommends that the JTC produce a table showing changes in model
structure and parameterization that have been implemented since 2011 as a standard
table to be included in the assessment document.}

\emph{Response -- The 2019 assessment includes Table~\ref{tab:main-assessment-changes}
that summarizes major changes to the model structure and parameterization since 2011.
Future assessments will include an updated version of the table as well.}

Finally, we note that we have complied with the following request from the 2017 SRG
concerning the sensitivity tests to perform in all future assessments:

{\bf The SRG requests that future assessments, beginning with 2018, include the following key
  sensitivity tests: natural mortality, stock-recruit steepness ($h$), $\sigma_r$,
  inclusion of the age-1 index, and exploring the degree of flexibility in time-varying
  selectivity or the $\phi$ parameter, as well as any others the JTC deems appropriate.}


\subsection{Modeling results}\label{sec:assessment-modeling-results}

\subsubsection{Changes from \Sexpr{last.assess.yr} }\label{sec:assessment-changes}

**A set of `bridging' models was constructed to evaluate the component-specific
effects of all changes from the \Sexpr{last.assess.yr} base model to
the \Sexpr{assess.yr} base model.

**[lots of years in here should be automated if the text is likely to always
refer to previous year - e.g. 2018 could probably be
\Sexpr{assess.yr}]
In short, these included the following
\begin{itemize}
  \item Update catch data from years prior to 2018.
  \item Update age composition data from years prior to 2018.
  \item Update weight-at-age data from years prior to 2018
  \item Add 2018 total catch.
  \item Add 2018 fishery age composition and weight-at-age data.
  \item Change fecundity (calculated as weight-at-age multiplied by maturity)
  from being time-invariant (using a single catch-weighted average of weight-at-age
  over all years) to time-varying (using year-specific weight-at-age).
\end{itemize}

**In general, these changes mimic the steps routinely applied, with a single
exception requiring additional explanation.

**The first set of bridging steps were conducted to ``Update'' data prior to 2018.
This primarily included minor adjustments in catch, fishery age composition, and
weight-at-age values, where a few additional samples from previous years,
especially from the end of 2017 that were not available in time for the \Sexpr{last.assess.yr}
assessment were included. These changes were small enough that they had
little impact on the model results (Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-biomass}).

**The addition of 2018 catch allowed the model to be
extended to the start of 2019, but the estimates for 2019 remained highly uncertain
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel.2}) in the absence of additional information
about recent recruitment.
%the addition of the 2017 survey biomass
%estimate, which reduced the estimated size of the 2014 year class, bringing
%down the estimated spawning biomass at the end of the time series as well as
%reducing the uncertainty.
The addition of 2018 fishery age composition information
% and survey
had relatively little additional impact on the biomass
estimates, indicating that the observed 2018 ages were consistent with the model
estimates without those data (Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel.2}).  However,
the addition of these data did alter recent recruitment
estimates, including an increase in the estimated size of the 2016 year class and
a reduction in the uncertainty associated with the relative recruitment strength of
the 2016 and 2017 year classes.

**In addition to fishery ages, this bridging step also included adding 2018 weight-at-age
data and updating other associated settings related to recruitment, combining multiple
elements that should be associated with each other. The assessment model separates the main
vector of recruitment deviations from those applied in the forecast,
because the deviations in
the `main' period are modeled as summing to zero to ensure that they are
equally balanced around the stock-recruit relationship. If forecast deviations
were included in this vector, this zero-sum constraint would have the potential
to cause those forecast deviations to differ from zero, even in the absence of
any data for the forecast years. The addition of the 2018 fishery composition data, which
included a relatively high proportion of age-1 fish from the 2017 cohort and
age-2 fish from the 2016 cohort, meant that
it was necessary to shift the endpoint of the main vector of recruitment deviations
to include 2017. The settings related to avoiding bias in recruitment estimation,
based on the method proposed by \citet{MethotTaylor2011}, were
also shifted by 1 year as part of this same bridging step, to account for
the addition of information about recruitment for the 2017 cohort.
Finally, this bridging step also shifted the ending year of the deviations
in the selectivity parameters from 2017 to 2018 since there was now fishery
data in 2018.

**The final bridging step involved changing the structural assumptions about
fecundity (discussed further in Sections~\ref{sec:data-maturity} and
\ref{sec:assessment-sensitivity-analyses}) and resulted in the 2019 base model (Table~\ref{tab:main-assessment-changes}).
The switch from time-invariant to time-varying
fecundity resulted in the biggest bridging change to current biomass.  Fecundity
(calculated as weight-at-age multiplied by maturity) changed from being defined by a
single catch-weighted average of weight-at-age applied to all years to being defined
by year-specific weight-at-ages covering the time period with data (1975-2018).
For periods without data (pre-1975 and post-2018),
catch-weighted average weight-at-age was used (however see Section~\ref{sec:assessment-fecundity-recap}
for discussion on alternatives). The results of this bridging
step caused a visible change in the time series
of spawning biomass (Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel.2})
as the fecundity of all cohorts were different leading to variability in the
time series of spawning
biomass. In spite of these changes to the estimated
spawning biomass, this bridging step had little impact
on recruitment, since the stock-recruit relationship indicates a
relatively weak link between spawning biomass and recruitment (see below).

%[** this section has been empty for the past few years....]

\subsubsection{Assessment model results}\label{sec:assessment-model-results}
\subsubsub{Model Fit}

**For the base model, the MCMC chain length was 24~million as it was in the
\Sexpr{last.assess.yr} assessment \citep{JTC2019}.
The first 4,000,000 values were discarded to eliminate `burn-in' effects and
each 10,000th value thereafter was retained, resulting in \Sexpr{num.mcmc.samples}
samples from the posterior distributions for model parameters and derived
quantities. Previous MCMC explorations indicated that $\log
\theta_{\text{surv}}$, the log of the $\theta$ parameter associated with the survey
data in the
Dirichlet-Multinomial (D-M) weighting,
was not being sampled efficiently due to many samples occurring in a part of the
parameter space where the effective sample size multiplier, $\theta_{\text{surv}}/(1+\theta_{\text{surv}})$,
is between 0.99 and 1.0. In this area, the input sample sizes are
given full weight and the likelihood surface is almost completely flat
with respect to this parameter.
Therefore, to improve MCMC convergence, $\log \theta_{\text{surv}}$
was fixed at the MLE estimate of \Sexpr{log.theta.survey},
corresponding to a weight of
$\theta_{\text{surv}}/(1+\theta_{\text{surv}}) = \Sexpr{DM.weight.survey}$.
The D-M parameter for the fishery weights was well sampled by the MCMC,
with a median estimate of
$\log \theta_{\text{fish}} = \Sexpr{log.theta.fishery.median}$ and an associated
median weight of
$\theta_{\text{fish}}/(1+\theta_{\text{fish}}) = \Sexpr{DM.weight.fishery.median}$.

**Stationarity of the posterior distribution for model parameters was
re-assessed via a suite of standard single-chain and multi-chain diagnostic tests.
The objective function, as
well as all estimated parameters and derived quantities, showed good mixing
during the chain, no evidence for lack of convergence, and low autocorrelation
(results for some key parameters are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:main-mcmc.diag.m.r0}
and~\ref{fig:main-mcmc.diag.h.extra.sd}). Correlation-corrected effective sample
sizes were sufficient to summarize the posterior distributions and neither the
Geweke nor the Heidelberger and Welch statistics for these parameters exceeded
critical values more frequently than expected via random chance
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc.diag.hists}).
% [repetition:]
% Traceplots show that the MCMC chain was
% well behaved and had little autocorrelation
% (Figures~\ref{fig:main-mcmc.diag.m.r0} and
% ~\ref{fig:main-mcmc.diag.h.extra.sd}).
The Gelman-Rubin multi-chain diagnostic test,
which compares within-chain variance to among-chain variance, further indicated that
convergence was adequately achieved (Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc.diag.gelrub}).
Correlations among key parameters were
generally low, with the exception of natural mortality, $M$, and the logarithm
of the unexploited
equilibrium recruitment level, $\log R_0$, (Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-pairs}).
Derived quantities for recruitment in 2008 and
2010 as well as the relationship between relative spawning biomass in
\Sexpr{end.yr} with the catch from default harvest rule in \Sexpr{end.yr}
were highly correlated, as to be expected given the dependencies
among these quantities (Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-pairs}). An examination of
deviations in recruitment (log-scale differences between estimated and expected
recruitment values) from recent years
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-pairs-recruit-devs}) indicates the highest
correlation
(\Sexpr{round(cor(base.model$mcmc$Main_RecrDev_2010,base.model$mcmc$Main_RecrDev_2012),2)})
between the 2010 and 2012 recruitment deviations. This continues to be likely
caused by the relative proportion of these two cohorts being better informed by
recent age-composition data than the absolute magnitude of these recruitments.

**[these years shouldn't be automated since refer to explicit years; check
everything is still true with latest base model]
The base model fit to the acoustic survey biomass index
(Figures~\ref{fig:main-survey-extrap-biomass} and~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-survey-fit})
remains similar to the \Sexpr{last.assess.yr} base model. The 2017
survey biomass estimate resulted in a downward shift in the fit to the 2015 survey data
point and a leveling off of the biomass trend over recent years
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-survey-fit}). The addition of 2018 fishery data
had negligible effect on the fit to survey biomass (Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel.2}).
The 2001 data point continues to be well below any model predictions that were evaluated,
and no direct cause for this is known.  The survey did begin earlier that year than all other surveys
between 1995 and 2009 (Table~\ref{tab:main-survey-history}), which may explain
some portion of the anomaly, along with El Ni\~no conditions and age
structure. The 2009 index is much higher than any predicted value observed
during model evaluation. The uncertainty of this point
(both modeled and actual) is also higher than in
other years, due to the presence of large numbers of Humboldt Squid during the
survey. Humboldt Squid have similar Target Strength to hake
which could introduce bias in the biomass estimate for that year, and
which also likely influenced hake population dynamics through predation in that year.

**The MLE and median posterior density estimate underfit the 2015 survey
index and overfit the 2017 survey index. This is likely due to fishery data suggesting
slightly different population dynamics than the survey in recent years.  This phenomenon can arise
when the fishery gets a prominent signal about age-1 fish, as it did in 2015,
whereas the survey contains information on age-2 and older fish.

**Fits to the age-composition data continue to show close correspondence to the
dominant cohorts observed in the data and also the identification of small
cohorts, where the data give a consistent signal
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-age-comp-fits}). Because of the time-varying fishery
selectivity, the fit to commercial age-composition data is particularly good,
although models with time-invariant selectivity used in previous years also fit
the age compositions well. The \Sexpr{last.assess.yr} age composition was
dominated by age-2 fish from the 2016 year-class (23\% of the catch in the
fishery), age-4 fish from the 2014 year-class (29\% of the catch in the fishery),
and age-8 fish from the 2010 year-class (24\% of the catch in the
fishery).  Age composition from the 2017 acoustic survey also indicated that the
2014 year-class (53\% of that catch that year) and the 2010 year-class (26\% of
the catch for that year) were large.
%%The 2017 acoustic survey was the first time the survey was able to sample the
%%2014 year-class, and it confirmed that the 2014 year-class (53\% of the
%%catch for that year) was indicated above average.
The pattern for the 2010 year-class was expected given the strength of that cohort
from the fishery composition data from 2012 onward, and thus are fit well by the
model. Combined, the 2015--2018 fishery age composition data and the 2017
acoustic survey age composition data suggest that 2014 was likely a strong recruitment
year, and the model was able to adequately
fit to these observations (Figure~\ref{fig:main-age-comp-fits}).  The 2016 year-class
has yet to be exposed to the acoustic survey, so the strength of this cohort is
reliant solely on two years of fishery data and thus remains highly uncertain. Residual
patterns to the fishery and survey age data do not show patterns that would
indicate systematic bias in model predictions
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-age-comp-pearson}). The MLEs for numbers, biomass,
exploitation rate and catch (in numbers and in biomass) for each age class in
each year are given in
Tables~\ref{tab:main-est-numbers-at-age}-\ref{tab:main-est-catch-at-age-biomass}.
For the major cohorts, the resulting age-specific catch, natural mortality and
surviving biomasses are given in Table~\ref{tab:main-cohort-effects}.

**Posterior distributions for both steepness and natural mortality are strongly
influenced by priors (Figure~\ref{fig:main-prior-posterior}). The posterior for
steepness was not updated much by the data, as expected given the low
sensitivity to steepness values found in previous hake assessments. The natural
mortality parameter, on the other hand, is shifted to the right of the prior
distribution and the prior may be constraining the posterior distribution from shifting
further. Broadening
the prior distribution by increasing the prior standard deviation for the natural mortality
parameter is examined in sensitivity runs (see Section~\ref{sec:assessment-sensitivity-analyses}).
Other parameters showed updating from non-informative priors to stationary posterior
distributions.

**The \Sexpr{assess.yr} base model specified the same level of variation (standard
deviation of $\Phi = 1.4$) associated with time-varying fishery selectivity as
the \Sexpr{last.assess.yr} base model, effectively
allowing the model flexibility (i.e., a lower penalty on the overall
likelihood) to fit to data that suggests high variability among years for each
age. This level
of variation led to results that were consistent with the 2017 acoustic survey
biomass estimate and gave reasonable fits to the fishery age composition data,
while maintaining that there is considerable uncertainty associated with
spatial changes in fish availability (due to movement) and recent
variability in oceanographic conditions.  Estimated selectivity deviations from
2010 to 2012 are the largest in recent years (Figures~\ref{fig:main-tv-selex}
and~\ref{fig:main-tv-selex-uncertainty}). The median selectivity peaks at age 4
in 2010 and 2012 and at age 3 in 2011 suggesting targeting of the younger cohorts
in those years. This pattern is consistent with the 2008 cohort appearing strong
in the fishery age compositions initially, but decreasing in prominence
from 2013 onward (Figures~\ref{fig:main-age-comp-fits} and
\ref{fig:main-retrospective.recruitment}).
Fishery selectivity on age-2 fish was at its highest
in 2016, followed by 2018.  The selectivity of age-3 fish by the fishery in 2017 (2014 cohort)
was similar to that for the 1999 and 2010 large cohorts
(age-3 in 2002 and 2013, respectively;
Figure~\ref{fig:main-tv-selex-uncertainty}). Even though the
survey selectivity is time invariant, the
posterior shows a broad band of uncertainty between ages 2 and 5
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-tv-selex-uncertainty-lines}). The decline in
survey selectivity between ages 3 and 4 may be an artifact of the interaction
between large cohorts and the biennial timing of recent surveys, with the
1999 cohort occurring in the survey at ages 2 and 4 but not 3
while the 2010 and 2014 cohorts occurred at ages 3 and 5 but not age 4.
Fishery selectivity is
likewise very uncertain (Figures~\ref{fig:main-tv-selex-uncertainty}
and~\ref{fig:main-tv-selex-uncertainty-lines}), but in spite of this
uncertainty, changes in year-to-year patterns in the estimates are still
evident, particularly for age-3 and age-4 fish, though these patterns might also
reflect time-varying mortality processes.

\subsubsub{Stock biomass}

**The base stock assessment model indicates that since the 1960s, \fishname\
female spawning biomass has ranged from well below to near unfished equilibrium
(Figures~\ref{fig:main-female-spawning-biomass}
and~\ref{fig:main-relative-spawning-biomass} and
Tables~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior} and \ref{tab:main-ci-posterior}). The
model estimates that it was below the unfished equilibrium in the 1960s and
1970s due to lower than average recruitment. The stock is estimated to have
increased rapidly to near unfished equilibrium after two or more large
recruitments in the early 1980s, and then declined steadily after a peak in the
mid- to late-1980s to a low in 2000. This long period of decline was followed by
a brief increase to a peak in 2002 as the large 1999 year class matured. The
1999 year class largely supported the fishery for several years due to
relatively small recruitments between 2000 and 2007. With the aging 1999 year
class, median female spawning biomass declined throughout the late 2000s,
reaching a time-series low of \Sexpr{median.bio.min}~million~t in
\Sexpr{median.bio.min.year}. The assessment model estimates that spawning
biomass declined slightly from 2014 to 2015 after four years of increases from
2010 to 2014. These estimated increases were the result of a large 2010 cohort
and an above-average 2008 cohort, and the decline in 2015 and 2016 is from the 2010 cohort
surpassing the age at which gains in weight from growth are greater than the
loss in weight from natural mortality. The model estimates an increase from 2016
to 2017 due to the large 2014 year class, which is estimated to be the fifth highest
recruitment in the time series, followed by a period of relatively steady biomass
from 2017 to 2019.

**The median estimate of the \Sexpr{end.yr} relative spawning biomass (female spawning
biomass at the start of \Sexpr{end.yr} divided by that at unfished equilibrium,
$B_0$) is \Sexpr{curr.depl.median}\% but is highly uncertain (with a 95\%
posterior credibility interval from \Sexpr{curr.depl.lower}\% to
\Sexpr{curr.depl.upper}\%; see Tables~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior} and
\ref{tab:main-ci-posterior}). The median estimate of the
female spawning biomass at the start of \Sexpr{end.yr} is
\Sexpr{curr.bio.median}~million~t (with a 95\% posterior credibility interval
from \Sexpr{curr.bio.lower} to \Sexpr{curr.bio.upper}~million~t).

**The estimated
\Sexpr{end.yr-1} female spawning biomass is
\Sexpr{prev.bio.median}~(\Sexpr{prev.bio.lower}-\Sexpr{prev.bio.upper})~million~t.
In the 2018 assessment, the equivalent estimate of 2018 female spawning biomass was
1.357~(0.610-3.161)~million~t. The 2019-estimated median is very similar to the 2018-estimated
median, while the credible interval has decreased with the addition of another year
of fishery data. **See comment for what we had in 2018 assessment.
%%The additional
%%data in the 2018 assessment has reduced the uncertainty of the 2017 biomass, and
%%decreased the median partly due to the impact of the survey biomass estimate.

\subsubsub{Recruitment}

**The new data available for this assessment do not significantly change the
estimated patterns of recruitment. \fishname\ appear to have low average
recruitment with occasional large year-classes
(Figures~\ref{fig:main-recruitment} and \ref{fig:main-recruitment-devs},
Tables~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior} and \ref{tab:main-ci-posterior}). Very
large year classes in 1980, 1984, and 1999 supported much of the commercial
catch from the 1980s to the mid-2000s. From 2000 to 2007, estimated recruitment
was at some of the lowest values in the time-series followed by a moderately
large 2008 year class. The current assessment continues to estimate a very strong 2010 year
class (Figure~\ref{fig:main-numbers-at-age}) comprising
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2013, spec.yr=2010)}\% of the coast-wide commercial catch in 2013,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2014, spec.yr=2010)}\% of the 2014 catch,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2015, spec.yr=2010)}\% of the 2015 catch,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2016, spec.yr=2010)}\% of the 2016 catch,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2017, spec.yr=2010)}\% of the 2017 catch, and
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2018, spec.yr=2010)}\% of the 2018 catch.
The current assessment also estimates a strong 2014 year class
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-numbers-at-age}) comprising
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2016, spec.yr=2014)}\% of the 2016 catch,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2017, spec.yr=2014)}\% of the 2017 catch,
and \Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2018, spec.yr=2014)}\% of the 2018 catch.
The 2016 cohort also appears to be strong at
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2018, spec.yr=2016)}\% of the 2018 catch.
Although the absolute size of the 2014 year
class remains highly uncertain, at least more so than
cohorts that have been observed for more years, three years of fishery data and one year of survey data
suggest that it is one of the higher estimates in the time series.  The 2016 year class is
estimated to be above average (similar in size to the 2008 year class) from two years
of fishery data. The 2016 year class will not be observed in the survey until
2019 as age-3 fish.

**The additional data in the 2019 assessment has reduced the median estimate of the
2014 year class to
\Sexpr{recruitment.med.in.2014}~billion fish (Table~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior}),
from the 8.583~billion estimated in the 2018 assessment (Table~18 of \citealt{JTC2018}).
Yet the 2014 year class remains the fifth largest estimated recruitment, albeit
with large uncertainty (Table~\ref{tab:main-ci-posterior} and
Figure~\ref{fig:main-recruitment}).  The median estimate for the 2016 year class
is \Sexpr{recruitment.med.in.2016}~billion fish (with a 95\% posterior credibility interval
from 0.746--26.085 billion fish; Tables~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior} and
\ref{tab:main-ci-posterior}).

**The model currently estimates small 2011, 2013, and 2015 year classes (median
recruitment below the mean of all median recruitments) and a slightly above
average 2012 and 2017 year class.  The proportion of the age-1 catch (in numbers
and biomass) in 2018 (2017 year class) was slightly larger than the age-1 catch
in 2017 (2016 year class).
% That's still true for 2016 assessment - see
%  years.since.2010.recruitment.med.below.mean
% Though could just say that all three years are smaller than average?
There is little or no information in the data to estimate the sizes of the
\Sexpr{end.yr-1} and \Sexpr{end.yr} year classes. Retrospective analyses of year
class strength for young fish have shown the estimates of recent recruitment to
be unreliable prior to at least age-3 \citep{JTC2013}.

**The estimated recruitments with uncertainty for each predicted point and the
overall stock recruit relationship are provided in
Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc.sr.variability}. Extremely large variability about the
expectation and about the joint uncertainty of individual recruitment and
spawning biomass pairs are evident in this plot. High and low recruitments have
been produced throughout the range of observed spawning biomass
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc.sr.variability}). The standard deviation of the time
series of median recruitment deviation estimates for the years 1970-2017, which
are informed by the age compositions, is
\Sexpr{f(sd(base.model$mcmccalcs$devmed[names(base.model$mcmccalcs$devmed) >=
1970 & names(base.model$mcmccalcs$devmed) <= 2017]), 2)}. This value is consistent
with the base model value of \Sexpr{base.model$sigma_R_in}.

\subsubsub{Exploitation status}

**Median relative fishing intensity on the stock is estimated to have been below
the SPR$_{40\%}$ target for all years
% sort(median.intensity)    % 2017 assessment 1999 was slightly over
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-fishing-intensity} and
Tables~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior} and \ref{tab:main-ci-posterior}). It
should be noted, however, that the median relative fishing intensity was close
to the target in 2008, 2010 and 2011, but harvest in those years did not exceed
the catch limits that were specified, based on the best available science and
harvest control rules in place at the time.
% Also close in 1999 but no TAC then according to landings.vs.tac[34,], so
%  don't mention 1999.
Exploitation fraction (catch divided
by biomass of fish of age-2 and above) has shown relatively similar patterns
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-exploitation-fraction} and and
Tables~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior} and
\ref{tab:main-ci-posterior}). Although displaying similar patterns, the exploitation
fraction does not necessarily correspond to fishing intensity because fishing
intensity more directly accounts for the age-structure of both the population and
the catch. Median relative fishing intensity is estimated to have declined from
\Sexpr{median.intensity.2010}\% in 2010 to \Sexpr{median.intensity.2015}\%
in 2015, after which it increased to \Sexpr{median.intensity.2018}\% in 2018.
The exploitation fraction has decreased from
\Sexpr{exploitation.med.2011} in 2011 to \Sexpr{exploitation.med.2015} in
2015 and then increased to \Sexpr{exploitation.med.2017} in 2017 before ending
at \Sexpr{exploitation.med.2018} in 2018.
Although there is a considerable amount of imprecision
around these recent estimates due to uncertainty in recruitment and spawning
biomass, the 95\% posterior credibility interval of relative fishing intensity
was below the SPR management target from 2012 through 2015 (Figure~\ref{fig:main-fishing-intensity}).
The median estimates
for 2016, 2017, and 2018 are below the management target, however the 95\% posterior
credibility intervals do include the target level.

% Note that exploitation.med.penult.yr comes out as 0.06, but in Table d
%  is 0.065, because the true value is 0.0648.... The text rounds to two decimal
%  places but Table rounds to three, but rounding is done correctly because of

%  could happen from looking at Table d (if the true value wasn't checked). Nice.

\subsubsub{Management performance}

**Over the last decade (\Sexpr{end.yr-10}--\Sexpr{end.yr-1}), the mean coast-wide
utilization rate (i.e., landings/quota) has been
\Sexpr{tot.last.10.years.attainment}\% and catches have been below
coast-wide targets (Table~\ref{tab:main-landings-tac}). From \Sexpr{end.yr-5} to
\Sexpr{end.yr-1}, the mean utilization rates differed between the United States
(\Sexpr{usa.last.5.years.attainment}\%) and Canada
(\Sexpr{can.last.5.years.attainment}\%). In 2015, the utilization rate for the
fishery was the lowest in the previous decade
(\Sexpr{tot.2015.attainment}\%) due, in part, to difficulties locating
aggregations of fish and possibly economic reasons.
% Manual done 2018 - check above sentence with
%  landings.vs.tac[landings.vs.tac$Year %in% (end.yr-10):(end.yr-1),10].
In years previous to 2015,
the underutilization in the United States was mostly a result of unrealized
catch in the tribal apportionment, while reports from stakeholders in Canada
suggested that hake were less aggregated in Canada and availability had
declined. In 2016, the utilization rate increased but remained below pre-2015
levels, despite the total 2016 catch being one of the highest in recent years.
This is in large part due to increasing catch targets as biomass continues to
increase.  The utilization rates in 2017 and 2018 continued to increase from the 2015 low in
both the United States and Canada. Total landings last exceeded the coast-wide quota
in 2002 when utilization was 112\%.

**The median relative fishing intensity was below target in all years throughout the time series
%the 1999 year used to be just above 1 but now estimated to be just below 1
% \Sexpr{median.intensity.above.one.years[-length(median.intensity.above.one.years)]} and
% Manual 2017 done - comment out above line if only one year, include it if
%  length(median.intensity.above.one.years) > 1
%\Sexpr{median.intensity.above.one.years[length(median.intensity.above.one.years)]}
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-fishing-intensity}).  The female spawning biomass was
above target all years except from 1999-2000 and from 2007-2011 (Figure~\ref{fig:main-phase}).
% Andy summarising (done 2018) those years manually, based on the values:
% \Sexpr{names(median.relative.bio.below.target[-length(median.relative.bio.below.target)])} and
% \Sexpr{names(median.relative.bio.below.target[length(median.relative.bio.below.target)])}.

**The joint history of biomass and $F$-based target reference points shows that
before 2007, median relative fishing intensity was below target and female
spawning biomass was mostly above $\Bforty$
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-phase}). Between 2007 and 2011, however, median relative
fishing intensity ranged from \Sexpr{median.intensity.2007.to.2011.min}\% to
\Sexpr{median.intensity.2007.to.2011.max}\% and median relative spawning biomass
between \Sexpr{median.relative.bio.2007.to.2011.min} and
\Sexpr{median.relative.bio.2007.to.2011.max}. Biomass has risen recently with
the 2008, 2010, and 2014 recruitments and, correspondingly, relative fishing
intensity fell well below targets. Relative spawning biomass has been
above the target since \Sexpr{median.relative.bio.above.target.since}. While
there is large uncertainty in the \Sexpr{end.yr-1} estimates of relative fishing
intensity and relative spawning biomass, the model estimates a \Sexpr{joint.percent.prob.above.below}\%
joint probability of being both above the target relative fishing intensity in
\Sexpr{end.yr-1} and below the $\Bforty$ relative spawning biomass level at the
start of \Sexpr{end.yr}.

\subsection{Model uncertainty}\label{sec:assessment-model-uncertainty}
 % Manual 2018 done
**The base assessment model integrates over the substantial uncertainty associated
with several important model parameters including: acoustic survey catchability
($q$), the magnitude of the stock (via the $R_0$ parameter for equilibrium
recruitment), productivity of the stock (via the steepness parameter, $h$, of
the stock-recruitment relationship), the rate of natural mortality ($M$), annual
selectivity for key ages, and recruitment deviations. The uncertainty portrayed
by the posterior distribution is a better representation of the uncertainty when
compared to asymptotic approximations about the maximum likelihood estimates
(MLE) because it allows for asymmetry (Figure~\ref{fig:main-prior-posterior};
also see \citealt{JTC2012} for further discussion and
examples).
Note that we use the term MLE even though the priors are involved in the likelihood
calculation and so the more accurate term would be the mode of the posterior density.
Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates} shows that most key derived
quantities from the posterior distribution are larger than their respective MLEs
(e.g., median biomass, recruitment, and relative spawning biomass), however some
parameter estimates (e.g., steepness and catchability) are
smaller. Figure~\ref{fig:main-mle.vs.mcmc} shows the MLE and Bayesian (from
MCMC) estimates as well as the skewed uncertainty in the posterior distributions
for spawning biomass and recruitment for each year.  Median estimates of spawning
biomass and recruitment from the posterior distribution are slightly larger than
their respective MLEs, but the 95\% credibility (posterior median) and confidence
(MLE) intervals overlap considerably.

**Next three paragraphs look good, maybe worth mentioning adnuts figure here somewhere?

Uncertainty measures in the base model underestimate the total uncertainty in
the current stock status and projections because they do not account for
alternative structural models for hake population dynamics and fishery processes
(e.g., recruitment, selectivity, or spatial fleet or population structure), the
effects of alternative data-weighting choices, and the scientific basis for prior
probability distributions. To address structural uncertainties, the JTC investigated
a range of alternative models, and we present the key sensitivity analyses along with
a suite of other informative sensitivity analyses.

The \fishname\ stock displays a very high degree of recruitment variability,
perhaps the largest of any west coast groundfish stock, resulting in large and
rapid biomass changes. This volatility, coupled with a dynamic fishery that
potentially targets strong cohorts (resulting in time-varying selectivity), and
little data to inform incoming recruitment until the cohort is at least age-2,
will in most circumstances continue to result in highly uncertain
estimates of current stock status and even less-certain projections of the stock
trajectory.

The JTC continues to be committed to advancing MSE analyses, by coordinating
research with the \fishname\ MSE Working Group and other scientists in the region
engaging in similar research. Incorporating feedback from JTC/JMC/AP/SRG/MSE
Working Group will ensure that constructed operating models will be able to
provide insight into the important questions defined by these groups.
Specifically, the development of MSE tools to evaluate major sources of
uncertainty relating to data, model structure and the harvest policy for this
fishery and compare potential methods to address them remains an important goal.

\subsection{Reference points}\label{sec:assessment-reference-points}
 % Manual 2019 done.
We report estimates of the base reference points (e.g., relative to $\Fforty$,
$\Bforty$, $\Bmsy$, and MSY) with posterior credibility intervals in
Table~\ref{tab:main-reference-points}. Only those based on $\Fforty$ explicitly
relate to target reference points per the treaty Agreement (see
Section~\ref{sec:intro-management} and Appendix~\ref{chap:glossary}). **The
estimates are only very slightly different than the estimates in the
\Sexpr{last.assess.yr} assessment (see also Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates}).

% 2018:
% with smaller equilibrium yields, spawning biomass, and
% recruitments (particularly for the 2014 year class) estimated in this assessment.

% Manual 2019 done.
% Look at dfo.probs.curr and decide what to write. Check that
%   ncol(base.model$risks[[1]]) == 10   (i.e. no new columns added)
**As part of the DFO Sustainable Fisheries Framework, \citet{DFO2009} suggested
a provisional limit reference point
(below which serious harm is believed to be occurring to the stock)
of $0.4\Bmsy$ and an upper stock reference point
(above which the stock is considered to be healthy)
of $0.8\Bmsy$. The probabilities of the female spawning biomass
at the start of \Sexpr{assess.yr} being above each of these points
are P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess.yr}} > 0.4\Bmsy) = \Sexpr{f(dfo.probs.curr[1,2])}$\% and
P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess.yr}} > 0.8\Bmsy) = \Sexpr{f(dfo.probs.curr[1,3])}$\%
such that the stock is estimated to be in the provisional `healthy zone'.

%PFMC refrence points for hake/whiting are: Bmsy = 0.4B0; MSST = 0.25B0.  Will report these as well.
**Reference levels of stock status that are used by the U.S. Pacific Fisheries Management
Council (PFMC) include $\Bforty$ and Minimum Stock Size
Threshold (MSST) = $\Btwentyfive$. For \Sexpr{min(forecast_yrs)}, the estimated
posterior median stock size for \fishname\ is above $\Bforty$ and well
above $\Btwentyfive$ at \Sexpr{curr.depl.median}\%.

**Andy to include probabilities of biomass $>\Bforty$ and $>Btwentyfive$ - in DFO
context these are the reference points and we'll need the probs for stock
summaries. We have the future probs below, just not current ones.

\subsection{Model projections}\label{sec:assessment-model-projections}
The median catch limit for \Sexpr{min(forecast_yrs)} based on the default
\Ffortyten{} harvest policy is \Sexpr{catch.limit.quantiles["median"]}~t, but
has a wide range of uncertainty (Figure~\ref{fig:main-projected-catch-density}),
with the 2.5\% to 97.5\% range being
\Sexpr{catch.limit.quantiles["lower"]}--\Sexpr{catch.limit.quantiles["upper"]}~t.

Decision tables give projected population status (relative spawning biomass) and
relative fishing intensity under different catch alternatives for the base model
(Tables~\ref{tab:main-decisions-biomass} and~\ref{tab:main-decisions-spr}). The
tables are organized such that the projected outcome for each potential catch
level and year (each row) can be evaluated across the quantiles (columns) of the
posterior distribution. Table~\ref{tab:main-decisions-biomass} shows projected
relative spawning biomass outcomes, and Table~\ref{tab:main-decisions-spr} shows
projected fishing intensity outcomes relative to the 100\% target (based on SPR;
see table legend).

**Relative fishing intensity exceeding 1 (or 100\% when shown as a percentage) indicates fishing in excess of the
$\Fforty$ default harvest rate catch limit. This can happen for the median
relative fishing intensity in \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[1:(length(forecast_yrs)-1)]}
and \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[length(forecast_yrs)]} because the $\Fforty$ default
harvest-rate catch limit is calculated using baseline selectivity from all
years, whereas the forecasted catches are removed using selectivity averaged
over the last five years. Recent changes in selectivity will thus be reflected
in the determination of overfishing. An alternative catch level where median
relative fishing intensity is 100\% is provided for comparison (catch
alternative e: FI=100\%).

Management metrics that were first identified as important to the Joint Management
Committee (JMC) and the Advisory Panel (AP) in 2012 are presented for
projections to \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[2:(length(forecast_yrs)-1)]} and
\Sexpr{forecast_yrs[length(forecast_yrs)]} (Tables~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1}
and~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-2}). These metrics summarize the probability of
various outcomes from the base model given each potential management
action. Although not linear, probabilities can be interpolated from this table
for intermediate catch
values. Figure~\ref{fig:main-forecast-depletion-comparison} shows the predicted
relative spawning biomass trajectory through
\Sexpr{forecast_yrs[length(forecast_yrs)]} for several of these management
actions. With zero catch for the next two years, the biomass has a probability
of \Sexpr{zero.catch.prob.bio.down.1}\% of decreasing from
\Sexpr{forecast_yrs[1]} to \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[2]}
(Table~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1} and
Figure~\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-1}), and a probability of
\Sexpr{zero.catch.prob.bio.down.2}\% of decreasing from \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[2]}
to \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[3]} (Table~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-2} and
Figure~\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-2}).

**The probability of the spawning biomass decreasing from \Sexpr{end.yr} to
\Sexpr{end.yr+1} is 50\% for some catch level between 180,000~t and
350,000~t (Table~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1} and
Figure~\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-1}). The model predicts high
biomass levels and the predicted probability of the spawning biomass dropping below
$\Bten$ ($0.1B_0$) in 2019 is
2\% or less and the probability of dropping below $\Bforty$ is 29\% or less
for all catches explored (Table~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1}). It should be noted
that the change in abundance of the 2010 year class is affected more by
decreases due to natural mortality than increases from somatic growth
and the model estimated below average recruitment for the 2011 and 2013
cohorts, but the above average predicted 2014 and 2016 year classes will result
in an increase to the spawning biomass as they enter maturity. The probability
that the \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[2]} spawning biomass will be less than the
\Sexpr{forecast_yrs[1]} spawning biomass ranges from 17\% to 77\%
depending on the catch level (Table~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1} and
Figure~\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-1}).

% This needs to be somewhat manual so you can pick the cohorts to specify.
**The age composition (in numbers) of the catch in \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[1]} is
projected to be (using MCMC medians)
\Sexpr{fore.catch.prop$Age3}\% age-3 fish from the 2016 year-class,
\Sexpr{fore.catch.prop$Age5}\% age-5 fish from the 2014 year-class and
\Sexpr{fore.catch.prop$Age9}\% age-9 fish from the 2010 year-class
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-age-comp-forecast}). However, those estimates are highly
uncertain with the 95\% credibility interval for the age-5 fraction spanning
\Sexpr{f(fore.catch.prop.age5.lower)}\%--\Sexpr{f(fore.catch.prop.age5.upper)}\%.
Due to the lower average weight at age 3 vs.~9, the expected
proportion of the \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[1]} catch by weight is expected to be reversed between
the 2016 and 2010 cohorts, at
\Sexpr{f(fore.catch.prop.wt.age3.median)}\% and
\Sexpr{f(fore.catch.prop.wt.age9.median)}\%,
respectively.

% Manual done 2019.
% Look at dfo.probs.fore and decide what to write. Check which row has the
%  largest catch level (it should be the min prob - look at a decision
%  table to check the catch and then look at dfo.probs.fore). Need to change
%  column heading calls here because years will change.
**Changed col heading to get running, need to check text.
With respect to the DFO provisional reference points, even with the largest
\Sexpr{assess.yr} catch of 725,593~t given in Table~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1},
at the start of \Sexpr{assess.yr+1} the stock is expected to be above the cautious zone with a probability of
P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess.yr+1}} > 0.4\Bmsy) = \Sexpr{f(min(dfo.probs.fore[,"SSB_2021>0.4SSB_MSY"]))}$\%,
and in the healthy zone with a probability of
P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess.yr+1}} > 0.8\Bmsy) = \Sexpr{f(min(dfo.probs.fore[,"SSB_2021>0.8SSB_MSY"]))}$\%.

%PFMC refrence points for hake/whiting are: Bmsy = 0.4B0; MSST = 0.25B0.  Will report these as well.
**With respect to PFMC stock size reference points, a level of 2019 catch consistent with the Treaty
default harvest control rule (725,593~t) has a 29\% estimated probability of the biomass going below
$\Bforty$ in 2020 (12\% probability of going below $\Btwentyfive$; Table~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1}).
That probabality decreases to 19\% and 5\%, respectively, if the catch level stays
the same in 2019 as in 2018.

\subsection{Sensitivity analyses }\label{sec:assessment-sensitivity-analyses}

**Sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate influence of data inputs and
structural uncertainty of the base model by investigating how changes to the
model affected the estimated values and derived quantities. For expediency,
almost all
sensitivity analyses compared MLE estimates rather than MCMC
posteriors. Therefore, the values reported below are not directly comparable to
the base model MCMC values reported elsewhere. For a comparison of the base model
MCMC and MLE estimates, see Tables~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1} and
\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-2}. The sensitivities
include the following:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Consideration of a higher standard deviation on the prior distribution
  for natural mortality;

\item Consideration of alternative values for steepness;

\item Assume higher/lower variation about the stock-recruitment curve
  ($\sigma_r$);

\item Include the age-1 survey index as an additional source of information;

\item Use of the McAllister-Ianelli method for data-weighting;

\item Use of the Francis method for data-weighting;

\item Consideration of alternative standard deviations for time-varying
  selectivity;

\item Consideration of an alternative parameterization for time-varying
  selectivity; and

\item Consideration of alternative assumptions concerning weight-at-age and
  fecundity.

\end{enumerate}


**In general, none of the sensitivities resulted in any significant departure from
the main population dynamics of the base model; all models showed large
estimated increases in spawning biomass in the early- to mid-2010s that continues to be
driven by the large 2010 cohort and the 2014 cohort. The overall scale of the
population was impacted by various alternative assumptions, and the highly
uncertain size of the recent large cohorts were more variable across sensitivity analyses
than earlier cohorts which have been observed in more years.

%%% 2018: commented text below leftover from 2017 document
%%The sensitivity of the base model to changes in the survey biomass estimates
%%as a result of not using the new extrapolation algorithm was conducted to
%%evaluate the impact of assuming negligible biomass outside the surveyed area,
%%or equally, that the population dynamics in the survey area are representative
%%of the stock as a whole (see discussion in
%%Section~\ref{sec:data-acoustic-survey} above).

% Leaving as one long line as easier to comment back in if needed (lots of calcs
% in here). May not be needed anyway.
%%The results of this model relative to the base model are shown in Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-2} and Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-2} and \ref{fig:main-recruitment-base-alternative-2}. In general, the estimated population dynamics are similar, regardless of extrapolation, throughout most of the time series.  However, there is some divergence in recent year estimates; e.g., the estimated relative spawning biomass in \Sexpr{end.yr} is \Sexpr{f(100*sens.models.2.for.table[[1]]$derived_quants["Bratio_2016","Value"],1)}\% for the base model (with extrapolation) and \Sexpr{f(100*sens.models.2.for.table[[2]]$derived_quants["Bratio_2016","Value"],1)}\% for the model without extrapolation. The 2016 default harvest control catch limit coming from the base model is \Sexpr{f(sens.models.2.for.table[[1]]$derived_quants["ForeCatch_2016","Value"])}~t compared to \Sexpr{f(sens.models.2.for.table[[2]]$derived_quants["ForeCatch_2016","Value"])}~t for the model using no extrapolation (using MLE values).

% MLE added to emphasise why numbers are different to usual (MCMC) base model
% ones.
% even though this is generlaized, it is not very general since the index
% number of the list is used

**Several key underlying structural model assumptions were identified that have
persisted across many previous hake assessments, and thus warrant revisiting
periodically as a set of reference sensitivity examinations to new base models.
Those identified here (as noted above) include the specification of natural mortality, the level
of variation assumed about the stock-recruitment relationship ($\sigma_r$), and
the resiliency of the stock in terms of recruitment (steepness).

% section below on natural mortality sensitivity
% Manual 2019 done
**The standard deviation of the prior distribution on natural mortality was
increased from the base model value of 0.1 to 0.2 and 0.3. Maximum likelihood
estimates of natural mortality increased from
\Sexpr{round(base.model$parameters$Value[1],3)} for the base model (prior
standard deviation of 0.1) to
\Sexpr{round(sens.models.1[[which(sens.model.names.1=="Natural Mortality (SD=0.3)")]]$parameters$Value[1],3)}
for the sensitivity run with the prior standard
deviation set to 0.3 (Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1}). In addition to allowing a higher estimated value for
natural mortality, the broader prior on M also increased the overall scale of
the population, the estimated stock status relative to $B_0$, and the
uncertainty in spawning biomass on both absolute and relative scales
(Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1} and Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-1}
and~\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-1}).

% section below on steepness sensitivity
% Manual 2019 done
**The mean of the prior distribution on steepness was decreased from 0.777 (base)
to 0.5 and, separately, steepness was fixed at 1.0. The decrease in the mean of the
prior resulted in a change in the maximum likelihood estimate of steepness from
\Sexpr{f(base.model$parameters["SR_BH_steep","Value"],3)} to
\Sexpr{f(sens.models.1[[which(sens.model.names.1=="Steepness Mean Prior Low (0.5)")]]$parameters["SR_BH_steep","Value"],3)}
(Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1}).
However, neither steepness
sensitivity analysis had a strong impact on the overall model results
(Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-1} and
\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-1}). The small influence of steepness on
model results is related to the relatively large $\sigma_r$ value which allows
the recruitments to deviate far from the underlying stock-recruit relationship
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc.sr.variability}).

% section below on sigma_r
% Manual 2019 done
**The value of $\sigma_r$ was changed from a value of 1.4 (base) to alternative
high (1.8) and low (1.0) states. The low value, $\sigma_r = 1.0$,
resulted in a model where the standard deviation of the MLE estimates of
recruitment deviations in the period with the most informative data was
\Sexpr{round(sens.models.1[[which(sens.model.names.1=="Sigma R 1.0")]]$sigma_R_info$SD_of_devs[1],2)},
suggesting that the data were inconsistent with the lower value of $\sigma_r$.
The high value, $\sigma_r = 1.8$, resulted in a model with a more
consistent standard deviation for the estimated recruitment deviations, at
\Sexpr{round(sens.models.1[[which(sens.model.names.1=="Sigma R 1.8")]]$sigma_R_info$SD_of_devs[1],2)}.
However, the high $\sigma_r$ model had a larger difference between the
spawning biomass at unfished
equilibrium and the spawning biomass at the initial year of the model
than the low $\sigma_r$ model
(Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1} and
Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-1} and
\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-1}). The method of \citet{MethotTaylor2011}
considers a combination of the variability among the
estimated deviations and the uncertainty around the estimates using the formula
\eb
\sigma_r^2 = \mbox{Var}(\hat{r}) + \overline{\mbox{SE}({\hat r}_y)}^2,
\ee
where $\mbox{Var}(\hat{r})$ is the variance among deviations and
$\mbox{SE}(\hat{r}_y)$ is the standard error of each estimate. It
produced a suggested
$\sigma_r$ of \Sexpr{sigma.r.alt.allyr}, which was similar to the
base-model value of 1.4.

% Manual 2019 done
**The sensitivity of the base model to the inclusion of the age-1 survey index
provides an additional source of information about the recruitment of different
year classes (see discussion in Section~\ref{sec:data-acoustic-survey}), which
can be particularly useful for the most recent years when little information on
cohort strength is otherwise available.  Compared to the base model, estimates
of spawning biomass throughout most of the time series are similar, but do
diverge near the end of the time series
(Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-2};
Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-2} and
\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-2}; \Sexpr{end.yr} estimates are
\Sexpr{f(100*sens.models.1.for.table[[1]]$derived_quants["Bratio_2018","Value"],1)}\%
of unfished biomass for the base model and
\Sexpr{f(100*sens.models.1.for.table[[8]]$derived_quants["Bratio_2018","Value"],1)}\%
for the age-1 index model). This change is likely due to the base model
underfitting the age-1 index estimates of the size of the 2012, 2014, and 2016 cohorts
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-age-one-index}). These changes are subtle
because the base model generally tracks the trends in the age-1 index well.
Including the age-1 index led to worse fits to the last year of the acoustic
survey compared to the base model (Figure~\ref{fig:main-index-base-alternative-2}).

% Manual 2018: removed in 2019
% The impact of assuming a time-invariant ageing error vector instead of a
% cohort-based ageing error matrix (as in the base model) was evaluated.  The
% largest changes to model results are associated with estimates of equilibrium
% unfished biomass and thus relative spawning biomass
% (Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1}).  These differences stem from
% the population model being restricted in the time-invariant case to fitting
% age-composition data with a stationary level of measurement error associated
% with each age.

% section below on composition weighting
% Manual 2019 done
**The sensitivity of the use of the
Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood, implemented in 2018,
which uses two estimated
parameters to automatically weight each of the fishery and survey age
compositions, was assessed by comparing the weightings to the
McAllister-Ianelli and Francis methods.
Both alternative methods require manual iterative adjustments to the input sample sizes
using a derived multiplier.
The McAllister-Ianelli method, which was used in assessments prior to 2018,
attempts to make the arithmetic mean of the input
sample size approximately equal to the harmonic mean of the effective
sample size.
The Francis method attempts to make the fit of the expected mean age
lie within the uncertainty intervals at a rate which is consistent
with variability expected based on the adjusted sample sizes.
The Dirichlet-Multinomial method
estimated higher weights on the age compositions but
generally very similar results to the McAllister-Ianelli method.
The McAllister-Ianelli method led to increased uncertainty in estimates of
early recruitments compared to other weighting methods
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-recruit-base-alternative-2}).
The Francis method increased the weighting of the fishery
composition data resulting in a similar time series of biomass, though
slightly reduced in scale. As noted in Section ~\ref{sec:data-age-comp-likelihood},
the Francis method is known to be sensitive to outliers and prone to convergence
issues when selectivity is time-varying, as it is in this assessment.

% The influence of an alternative approach for calculating the 2017 fishery age
% composition was also explored. In most years,
% nearly all the available \fishname\ otoliths caught in U.S. waters are aged and then
% used, along with data from Canada, to develop an annual age composition for
% the fishery (see Section~\ref{sec:data-fishery-biological-data}). High catch levels in 2017, resulting
% from high estimates of abundance and associated TACs, and it being a survey year has
% led to an increase in the total number of otoliths sampled for ageing.  For 2017,
% nearly 77\% (2,369 out of 3,090) of the U.S. at-sea sectors otoliths were aged in time
% for this assessment (typically greater than 95\% are aged).  Recently, the
% seasonality of catch-at-age has become even more apparent with the large 2010 and 2014 cohorts, resulting in
% younger individuals being caught in larger proportions later in the year. This can lead
% to bias when the unread otoliths are also from later in the year when aggregating to a single annual
% age composition. In response, the JTC calculated a monthly catch weighted
% annual composition for the U.S. at-sea sectors, and then combined that with the compositions
% from other sectors following standard procedures \citep{JTC2013, JTC2014}. The result
% was minor differences in the overall fishery age composition (Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1}):
% less than a 0.4\% change for
% all ages except the 2014 cohort (increase 2.1\%) and the 2010 cohort (decrease 1.0\%).
% These relatively minor differences also had little to no influence on estimates of spawning
% biomass (Figure~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-2}) or stock status
% (Figure~\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-2}) in 2018. Nonetheless, otolith
% subsampling protocols should be developed to account for seasonality in catch-at-age.  Such
% protocols are especially critical during survey years or years of high abundance when large
% sample sizes are expected or when ageing laboratory resources are limited.

% of total catch that were identified late in the assessment process (as

% The average change in catch for the period in question, 2007 to 2017, was 0.5\%
% which was too small to make a noticable impact in the time series of spawning biomass
% (Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-2} and

% section below on selectivity
% Manual 2019
**The following two types of alternative setups for selectivity were explored in sensitivity
analyses: alternative values of the $\Phi$ parameter
controlling the degree of flexibility of annual variation in the
fishery selectivity and an alternative ``semi-parametric''
parameterization of the time-varying selectivity
(Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-4}-\ref{fig:main-index-base-alternative-4}).
The methods and results of each will be described in turn.

% Removed by KFJ in 2019
% Fishery and survey selectivity in the base model is modeled as changing
% from each age to the next up to age 6 beyond which it is assumed constant.
% Three alternative maximum selectivity age values (5, 7, and 10) were considered to
% investigate the
% asymptotic properties of fishery and survey selectivity patterns and the impact
% maximum selectivity age has on model behavior. For each alternative option
% all of the ages with estimated fishery selectivity had annual deviations
% estimated for the corresponding parameters. Thus, a change from age-6 to
% age-7 as the maximum selectivity age was associated with 29 additional
% parameters, 1 each for the additional age in the fishery and the selectivity
% % parameter counts below aren't dynamic
% and 27 deviations for the years 1991 to 2017.

% The estimated population trends
% throughout the time series are similar, irrespective of maximum selectivity age
% (Figures~\ref{fig:main-base-alternative-3}-\ref{fig:main-index-base-tv-increase-1}).
% However, absolute levels of
% spawning biomass are different, particularly for the age-10 case. Under all
% alternatives, the base model pattern of a decline in survey
% selectivity between ages 3 and 4 remained, and was either increased or repeated
% at additional ages (Figure~\ref{fig:main-base-alternative-3}).
% As noted in Section~\ref{sec:assessment-model-results}, a potential
% cause of this zig-zag pattern is the
% interaction of the biennial timing for much of the survey history with large
% cohorts. The 1999 cohort made up the majority of the observed ages in the survey
% when they were age 2, 4, 6, and 8, while the 2010 and 2014 cohorts have
% primarily been observed when they were age 3, 5, or 7. Thus, any
% differences in the dynamics of these cohorts that are not represented in the model,
% such as differences in natural
% mortality, would lead to a shift
% in selectivity between the even- and odd-numbered ages.
% The choice of age 6 as the maximum was retained in the base model as it
% was more flexible than the choice of age 5 while those with higher ages
% produces less plausible patterns of selectivity.

**The consideration of alternative standard deviations ($\Phi$) for time-varying
selectivity is discussed earlier in
Section~\ref{sec:data-variability-selectivity}. In short, low values of the
parameter $\Phi$ controlling the flexibility in time-varying selectivity
resulted in potentially implausibly high estimates for recent recruitments. The
% values of the related $\phi$ explored in the 2017 assessment \citep{JTC2017}
% were 0.03, 0.10,
% and 0.30, as alternatives to the 0.20 used in the base model.
% As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:data-variability-selectivity}, the change
% to the new version of Stock Synthesis required
% appropriate values of $\Phi$, with
% $\Phi = 7 \phi$
% resulting in
% approximately equivalent dynamics. Thus, the
base model value is $\Phi = 1.40$, and
alternatives explored as sensitivity analyses were 0.21, 0.70, and 2.10.
The addition of the 2017 fishery age compositions and the 2017 survey biomass
estimate and age compositions led to more precise estimates of the 2014
recruitment, regardless of the value of $\Phi$. However, the 2016 recruitment,
which is only informed by the 2017 and 2018 fishery age compositions, is strongly
linked to the choice of $\Phi$, where the model with the smallest $\Phi$
at 0.21 estimates
the 2016 and 2017 recruitment deviations as the highest in the time series
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-recruit-base-alternative-4}) and provides the worst
fit to the recent survey biomass estimates
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-index-base-alternative-4}).

**The alternative ``semi-parametric'' setup for selectivity based on the work of
\citet{Xu2019} differs from the status-quo approach in that the deviations
are applied to the resulting selectivity estimates, not to the original
parameters, and the resulting selectivity ogive is no longer constrained
between 0 and 1 (Figure~\ref{fig:main-selectivity-illustration}). That is,
the deviations are no longer applied as shown in equation (4), but as
exponential multipliers on the baseline selectivity
\eb
S_{ay} = S_a \cdot \exp(\epsilon_{ay})
\ee
where the $S_{ay}$ are derived as described in equations (1)-(3), the
$\epsilon_{ay}$ are the selectivity deviations, $\sigma_s$ is
the parameter which controls the variability in the deviations
(equivalent to $\Phi$ in the base model parameterization), and the
likelihood contribution for the $\epsilon_{ay}$ parameters is
from treating the deviations as normal random variables with
standard deviation $\sigma_s$, $N(0, \sigma_s)$.

**This alternative parameterization was expected
to reduce correlation among the deviation
parameters, because a positive deviation at a younger age no longer leads to
a rescaling of the selectivity pattern at all ages. Indeed, there are only
7 pairs of parameters with correlations above 0.7 or below -0.7 in the
semi-parametric model that most closely matched the base model
($M$ and $\log R_0$ were positively correlated and the deviations for
selectivity at ages 1 and 3 in 2017 and 1, 2, and 4 in 2018 were
correlated with each other or 2016 or 2017 recruitment).
This is in contrast to the base model, which had 38 parameter pairs with
correlations above 0.7 or below -0.7, of which 35 of the pairs were
between two of the selectivity deviations.
% The Laplace method of
% \citet{ThorsonHicksEtAl2014} also provided an estimate of the
% variance parameter for the semi-parametric selectivity,
% at $\sigma_s = 0.695$, which provided more plausible results than when this
% method was applied to the status-quo selectivity setup.

**However, the model with $\sigma_s = 0.695$ had higher estimates of 2016
and 2017 recruits
and worse fits to the recent survey biomass estimates
(Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-4}-\ref{fig:main-index-base-alternative-4}).
Increasing $\sigma_s$ to 1.0
provided the additional flexibility required to give more plausible estimates
of this cohort that has only been observed as age-1 and age-2 fish in the fishery.
However, relying on the subjective choice of $\sigma_s = 1.0$ removed one of
the potential benefits of the semi-parametric approach. Given that an MCMC
chain of 24-million samples has been adequate to overcome the inefficient
sampling caused by high parameter correlations in the status-quo approach,
the parameter selectivity was kept as before for this assessment, with the
hopes that the semi-parametric setup could be further explored in the year
ahead for potential inclusion in a future assessments.

**Sensitivity runs concerning weight-at-age and fecundity are discussed in
Sections~\ref{sec:assessment-fecundity-recap} and~\ref{sec:assessment-sensitivity-fecundity} (Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-3}).
Any additional sensitivity runs arising from the Scientific Review Group
meeting to be held from 19th February to 22nd February 2019 will be documented
in Appendix~\ref{chap:srg-requests} and briefly summarized here.

% 2019 SRG -
%%**Several additional sensitivity runs were completed in response to SRG requests
%%during the Feb 13-16, 2017 meeting in Vancouver, B.C., Canada (see
%%Appendix~\ref{chap:srg-requests}).  These include model sensitivity to the
%%standard deviation associated with time-varying selectivity, further inclusion
%%of the age-1 index, and model convergence diagnostics when using a longer MCMC
%%chain.

%%Several key underlying structural model assumptions were identified that have persisted across many previous hake assessments, and thus warrant revisiting periodically as a set of reference sensitivity examinations to new base models.  Those identified here include the specification of natural mortality, the level of variation assumed about the stock-recruitment relationship ($\sigma_r$), and the resiliency of the stock in terms of recruitment (steepness).  The sensitivity of the base model to changes in the input $\sigma_r$ and to the prior distributions for natural mortality and steepness were explored.  The standard deviation of the prior distribution on natural mortality was increased from 0.1 (as in the base model) to 0.2 and 0.3.  The mean of the prior distribution on steepness was decreased from 0.777 (base) to 0.500, and steepness was also fixed at 1.0.  The value of $\sigma_r$ was changed from a value of 1.4 (base) to alternative high (2.0) and low (1.0) states.  These key sensitivities had little effect on the overall estimated population trend throughout the time series (Figure~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-1}), but they do have a significant impact on the estimated scale of the population (quite different estimates of $B_0$ and $R_0$ parameters; Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1}).  The least influential in terms of relative spawning biomass (Figure~\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-1}) as compared to the base model is fixing steepness to 1.0, changing the prior mean on steepness, and moderately changing the prior standard deviation on natural mortality (0.2).  The greatest difference in stock status compared to the base model results from changing the input for $\sigma_r$.  Estimates of natural mortality increased from 0.215 for the base model (prior standard deviation of 0.1) to 0.250 for the sensitivity run with the prior standard deviation set to 0.3.  When the mean of the prior distribution for steepness was changed from 0.777 (base model) to 0.5, the estimate for steepness decreased from 0.861 to 0.602.

\subsubsection{Recap of alternative 2018 model  run with time-varying fecundity}\label{sec:assessment-fecundity-recap}

**Prob not needed again, or just a reduced version.

In 2018 the SRG requested an alternative model run that used time-varying
fecundity \citep{JTC2018}. We have used time-varying fecundity in the 2019 base model,
and in three sensitivity runs with alternative assumptions about the weights-at-age
for the years without data. For a given year, fecundity is the
(element-wise) product of the maturity ogive and the weight-at-age
vector for that year. Thus, the alternative weight-at-age assumptions
affect the fecundity. We also tested these four alternative assumptions
when using non-time-varying fecundity. The eight combinations are summarised
in Table~\ref{tab:main-wtatage-runs}, and the four weight-at-age assumptions
are shown in the heatmaps in
Figures~\ref{fig:main-empirical.weight.at.age.sens.a}--\ref{fig:main-empirical.weight.at.age.sens.d}.
The eight runs are first explained in the context of the 2018 assessment, with justification
of our base model; results are
then given in \ref{sec:assessment-sensitivity-fecundity}.

There were four components to the SRG-requested alternative model run that
used time-varying fecundity (see p23 of \citealt{JTC2018}):

a) ``Add time-varying fecundity by multiplying the weight-at-age matrix (rather than
   an overall mean weight-at-age vector as in the base model) and the new maturity ogive
   to get annual estimates of fecundity from 1975--2017.''

We have done this in the 2019 base model (for the updated time period
1975--2018) because it is more consistent with time-varying weight-at-age
than the non-time varying fecundity used in the 2018 base model. The
fecundity for the 2018 base model came from multiplying the maturity ogive by
an average weight-at-age vector
to give age-dependent fecundity that was constant in time. Sensitivity
runs 54, 55 and~58 retain the time-varying fecundity of the base model.
Sensitivity runs 52, 53, 56 and~57 use non-time-varying fecundity, as per the
2018 base model (Table~\ref{tab:main-wtatage-runs}).

b) ``Set equilibrium and 1966-1974 fecundity (where empirical data are not
available) to the product of maturity and the mean weight-at-age averaged
over 1975-1979.''

We have not done this in the 2019 base model, as described in
Section~\ref{sec:assessment-response-review}, but are using the long-term average
(1975-2018) for the equilibrium and
1966-1974 fecundity, as for the 2018 base model. Using the fecundity based on
1975-1979 is examined in sensitivity runs 55, 56, 57 and~58.

c) ``Set forecast-year fecundity (including 2017 due to current configurations in
Stock Synthesis) weight-at-age to the product of maturity and mean weight-at-age
over 2015-2017.''

We found no compelling evidence to use the short-term mean
(2016-2018) for the forecasts, as described in Section~\ref{sec:assessment-response-review}.

Also, the `current configuration of Stock Synthesis' issue is the
requirement that the forecast years' weights-at-age be either (i)~the same as the
pre-data (pre-1975) years, or (ii)~the same as the final year of data (2018).
Thus, we cannot set the forecast years' weights-at-age to be the mean of
2016-2018 without setting the 2018 weights-at-age to be this, which seems
inappropriate for the base model (but is tested in runs~52, 54, 56 and~58).
So, for the 2019 base model
we retained the 2018 base model's assumption of using the mean from 1975-2018 for
projections (which satisfies the requirement (i) of Stock Synthesis just described).

Similarly, we cannot set the forecast year's weights-at-age to be the mean of
1975-2018 when the pre-1975 weight-at-age is 1975-1979, without setting the 2018 weights-at-age
to also be the mean from 2016-2018 (as noted in Section~\ref{sec:assessment-response-review}).
This setting is done for model runs 55 and~57, but precludes
run~55 from being a sensible base model because the 2018 weights-at-age are not
the true 2018 data (and run~57 does not use time-varying fecundity). Run~53 uses
the same weight-at-assumptions as the base model but does not use time-varying fecundity.

% Aside for 2019. When we didn't have the 2018 age data we set it to be the mean
% from 2016-2018, which serendipitously avoided the configuration issue, and so
% we had the equivalent to run 54 as the base case.

d) The inconsistency regarding still using the mean weight-at-age for calculating
\emph{stock biomass} is discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:assessment-response-review}, and is fully resolved for all runs
in 2019.

% [Hence wtatage.ss has -2018 rows for fecundity
%  and for the weight-at-age matrices].

\subsubsection{Fecundity and weight-at-age sensitivities}\label{sec:assessment-sensitivity-fecundity}

**Whole section needs a look at, with major culling as we're not repeating all
these in 2020.

In 2018, the aforementioned alternative model run was investigated using
a full MCMC computation to allow for the presentation of decision tables and
projections. For 2019, all eight combinations in Table~\ref{tab:main-wtatage-runs}
underwent full MCMC computations.
The runs are labeled with run numbers which were used internally by the JTC
and are not relevant other than to refer to each run uniquely. The extrapolation of pre-1975
weights-at-age is required because there is catch in the model from 1966 onward but age
and weight data were not collected until 1975.

The 2018 base model had the same assumptions as run 53, with one less year of
data (Table~\ref{tab:main-wtatage-runs}). These assumptions are
non-time-varying fecundity,
long-term (1975--2018) mean weights-at-age applied for the years 1966--1974, and
long-term (1975--2018) mean weights-at-age applied for the years 2019--2021
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-empirical.weight.at.age.sens.a}).

The 2018 alternate model was similarly analogous to run 58 (Table~\ref{tab:main-wtatage-runs}), which had time-varying
fecundity, short-term (1975--1979) mean weights-at-age applied for the years 1966--1974, and
short term (2016--2018) mean weights-at-age applied for the years 2017--2021.
Recall the aforementioned configuration issue, that when models use a different set of weights-at-age for the forecast years
than for the 1966--1974 period, the last year of data (2018) cannot be included. Instead,
the current configuration of Stock Synthesis requires 2018 to be used as a placeholder for
the forecasting weights-at-age vector.

This year's base model is a hybrid of the 2018 models, based on the 2018 base model
but with the inclusion of time-varying fecundity.

There were five further runs done, overall covering all possible combinations of long- or short-term mean
pre-1975 weights-at-age, long- or short-term mean post-2017 weights-at-age, and time-varying
fecundity being included or not.

Weights-at-age for runs which use the long-term (1975--2018) mean for both the pre-1975
and post-2018 periods can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:main-empirical.weight.at.age.sens.a}. This figure includes run 53
and the base model.

Weights-at-age for runs which use the short-term (1975--1979) mean for the pre-1975
period and the long-term (1975--2018) mean for the post-2017 period can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:main-empirical.weight.at.age.sens.b}. This figure includes runs 55
and 57.

Weights-at-age for runs which use the long-term (1975--2018) mean for the pre-1975
period and the short-term (2016--2018) mean for the post-2017 period can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:main-empirical.weight.at.age.sens.c}. This figure includes runs 52
and 57.

Weights-at-age for runs which use the short-term (1975--1979) mean for the pre-1975
period and the short-term (2016--2018) mean for the post-2017 period can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:main-empirical.weight.at.age.sens.c}. This figure includes runs 56
and 58.

MCMC runs with a chain length of 12,000,000 were done for these sensitivities. The
first 2,000,000 values were discarded to eliminate `burn-in' effects and each
5,000th value thereafter was retained, resulting in 2,000 samples from the posterior
distributions for model parameters and derived quantities. Comparisons of both the
MLE and median posterior biomass and relative biomass trajectories with 95\% credible
intervals follow.

The base model and runs 52, 53, and 54 are compared in
Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-5}--\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-5-mcmc}.
These are the runs which have the pre-1975 weights-at-age being set to the
long-term mean from 1975--2018. Runs 52 and 53 show little difference
from one another, implying that changing the post-2017 weights-at-age does not have much effect
on model outcome. However, they show a noticeable decrease in the estimated
spawning biomass (compared to the base model) in and around the 1975 time period
(Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-5} and~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-5-mcmc}).
The peak in biomass for the base model is caused by the weights-at-age in
the early part of the time series being significantly
higher for older fish and having the fecundity in that time period change
accordingly when using time-varying fecundity.

Run~54 also includes time-varying fecundity and exhibits the biomass peak around
1975. Note that
it is difficult to see the difference between the base model and run 54 using the MLE plots
(because their only difference is in the weight-at-age for 2018 onwards).
The MCMC plots allow us to see that the blue and red lines (base model and run 54) follow similar trajectories
(Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-5-mcmc} and~\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-5-mcmc}).

The base model, and runs 55, 56, 57, and 58 are compared in
Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-6}--\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-6-mcmc}.
These are the runs which have the pre-1975 weights-at-age being set to the
short term mean (1975--2018). Runs 55 and 58 appear to have similar trajectories to one another,
as do runs 56 and 57. The difference between these two groups is the inclusion of time-varying fecundity.

Having non-time-varying fecundity and using short-term
pre-1975 mean weights-at-age (runs 56 and 57) give an inflated 2019 stock size
(Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-6} and~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-6-mcmc}),
but due to the inflation of the initial biomass give a similar stock status to the base model
(Figures~\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-6} and~\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-6-mcmc}).

Runs 55-58 produce an inflated initial biomass, due to the use of a short-term (1975--1979) mean
weight-at-age being used for the pre-1975 time period. The weights-at-age for older fish in
those early years is significantly higher than the long-term mean as can be seen in
Figures~\ref{fig:main-empirical.weight.at.age.sens.b}--\ref{fig:main-empirical.weight.at.age.sens.d}.

MCMC results for runs 53 and 54 including decision tables can be found in
Appendices~\ref{chap:fecundity-53} and \ref{chap:fecundity-54}, because these
are the closest runs to the 2019 base model.

\subsection{Retrospective analyses}\label{sec:assessment-retrospective-analyses}

**Retrospective analyses were performed by iteratively removing the terminal
years' data and estimating the parameters under the assumptions of the base
model. Models with 3, 4, or 5 years of data removed had information
available regarding the high 2010 year class, but did not yet have information on the
2014 year class (Figure~\ref{fig:main-biomass-recruitment-retrospective}). Models
with 1 and 2 years of data removed were just beginning to receive data on age-3 and age-2, respectively,
individuals to to predict the size of the 2014 year class.  The base model now has
\Sexpr{number.to.word(assess.yr - 2014 - 1)} years of data to estimate the size of
the 2014 cohort, and the uncertainty around this
estimate has been considerably reduced compared to one year ago
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-biomass-recruitment-retrospective}).

**Overall, there is little retrospective change to the relative spawning biomass
trajectory up to the mid-2010s, and most retrospective change occurs in the
final years of the retrospective model. Retrospective estimates over the last five
years have been predominantly positively biased. In the last four years, the
stock assessment has retrospectively overestimated the status in the terminal year,
which is likely related to the dynamics introduced by the large 2010 and 2014 cohorts
and the high observed survey biomass index in 2009.

**Figure~\ref{fig:main-retrospective.recruitment} shows the retrospective patterns
of estimated recruitment deviations for various cohorts. The magnitude of the
deviation is not well estimated until several ($\sim$4-9) years of fishery
catch-at-age data and survey age-composition data have been collected on the
cohort. Very strong and weak cohorts tend to be identified in the model at a
younger age than intermediate cohorts. For example, the strong 2010 cohort has
been fairly well determined in the model by age-4 and the weak 2007 cohort by
age-6.  Estimated recruitment deviations for the 2014 cohort appear to be
similar to other large cohorts (1999, 2008, and 2010), though with the extra years
of data in this and last year's assessment the 2014 cohort appears to maybe be more similar
to the 2008 cohort rather than the 1999 and 2010 cohorts (which are the largest).
% One major difference between the 2010 and 2014
% cohorts is that by age-3 the 2010 cohort had been fully sampled by the acoustic
% survey (when they were age-3 in the assessment model), whereas the 2014 cohort
% was not sampled by the survey until they were age-4 in the assessment
% model.
The variability among cohort estimates relative to their estimated size
in the base model (Figure~\ref{fig:main-relative-retrospective.recruitment})
further indicates that the estimates can start to improve as early as age-3, but
some may not stabilize until the cohort approaches an age upward of 7 years
old. This illustrates that multiple observations of each cohort are needed in
order to more accurately determine their recruitment strength.

**A comparison of the actual assessment models used in each year since
\Sexpr{min(assessment.history$Year)} is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-assessments}. There have been substantial
differences in model structural assumptions and thus results submitted each
year, which can clearly be seen by looking at the spawning biomass
trajectories. The variability between models, especially early on in the time
series, is larger than the uncertainty (95\% credibility interval) reported in
any single model in recent years. One important avenue that was investigated
between 2004 and 2007 was the inclusion of several different, but fixed, survey
catchability ($q$) values followed by a span of years (2008 to present) where it
was freely estimated by the model. In all years prior to 2004, survey
catchability was fixed at 1.0. The fixing of survey catchability had the effect
of driving the estimate of initial biomass upward, which in turn scaled the
entire biomass trajectory up, leading to higher estimates of relative spawning
biomass than in more recent assessments. The median estimates of
spawning biomass for recent years have declined in the \Sexpr{end.yr} assessment relative
to recent assessments.  Although
the model structure has remained relatively consistent in recent years, the 2017 acoustic
survey biomass estimate was lower than what previous models would have predicted.
The uncertainty interval associated with the \Sexpr{end.yr} assessment brackets the majority of the
historical estimates.
