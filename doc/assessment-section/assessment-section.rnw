\section{ASSESSMENT}\label{sec:assessment}

\subsection{Modeling history}\label{sec:assessment-modeling-history}

In spite of the relatively short history of fishing, \fishname\ have surely been
subject to a larger number of stock assessments than any marine species off the
west coast of the U.S.~and Canada. These assessments have included a large
variety of age-structured models. Initially, a cohort analysis tuned to fishery
CPUE was used \citep{FrancisSwartzmanEtAl1982}. Later, the cohort analysis was
tuned to National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) triennial acoustic survey estimates of absolute abundance at age
\citep{HollowedAdlersteinEtAl1988}. Since 1989, Stock Synthesis models using
fishery catch-at-age data and acoustic survey estimates of population biomass
and age composition have been the primary assessment method
\citep{JTC2019}.

While the general form of the age-structured assessment has remained similar since 1991,
management procedures have been modified in a variety of ways. There have been
alternative data choices, post-data collection processing routines, different
data-weighting schemes, many structural assumptions for the stock
assessment model, and alternative control rules (Table~\ref{tab:main-assessment-changes}).

Data processing, choices, and weighting have been modified several times in
historical hake assessments. For example, the processing of acoustic data has been
modified over the years through modifications to target strength calculations
\citep{DornSaunders1997} or the introduction of kriging
\citep{StewartHamel2010}. While survey data have been the key index for
abundance since 1988, surveys that have been used have varied considerably. The
AFSC/NWFSC triennial bottom trawl survey was used from 1988 before being
discarded from the 2009 assessment (by \citealt{HamelStewart2009}). Acoustic
surveys from the years prior to 1995 were used for assessments in the early
1990s, but \citet{StewartForrestEtAl2011} reviewed these early surveys and
deemed that sampling had been insufficient to be comparable with more
recent data. Various recruitment indices have also been considered, but subsequently
rejected \citep{HelserDornEtAl2002, HelserFleischerEtAl2005,
StewartHamel2010}. The process for generating fecundity-at-age from weight-at-age data
changed in 2019 from using time-invariant to year-specific values.
Even where data have been consistently used, the weighting of these data
in the statistical likelihood has changed through the use of various emphasis factors
(e.g., \citealt{Dorn1994, DornSaundersEtAl1999}), a multinomial sample
size on age compositions (e.g., \citealt{DornSaundersEtAl1999, HelserDornEtAl2002,
HelserFleischerEtAl2005, StewartForrestEtAl2011}),
internal estimations of effective sample size using the
Dirichlet-Multinomial distribution \citep{JTC2018},
and assumptions regarding year-specific
survey variance. The list of changes discussed above is for illustrative
purposes only; it is only a small fraction of the different data choices
analysts have made and that reviewers have required.

The structure of the assessment models has perhaps had the largest number of
changes. In terms of spatial models, analysts have considered
spatially explicit forms \citep{Dorn1994, Dorn1997}, spatially implicit forms
\citep{HelserStewartEtAl2006}, and single-area models \citep{JTC2012}. Predicted
recruitment has been modeled by sampling historical recruitment (e.g.,
\citealt{Dorn1994, HelserFleischerEtAl2005}), using a stock-recruitment
relationship parameterized using maximum sustainable yield ($\text{MSY}$) and
the fishing mortality rate estimated to produce the MSY ($\Fmsy$; \citealt{Martell2010}),
and using several alternative steepness priors \citep{JTC2012,
JTC2013}. Selectivity has also been modeled in several ways,
invariant \citep{JTC2012, JTC2013}, time-varying with \citep{HelserDornEtAl2002}
and without \citep{Dorn1994, DornSaunders1997, JTC2012, JTC2013} a random walk, and
alternative levels of allowable deviation through time \citep{JTC2013, JTC2017},
age-based \citep{Dorn1994, DornSaunders1997, JTC2012, JTC2013}, and length-based
\citep{HelserMartell2007}.

Several harvest control rules have been explored for providing catch limits from
these stock assessments. \fishname\ stock assessments have presented decision
makers with constant $F$, variable $F$, and the following hybrid control rules:
$F_{\text{SPR}=35\%}$, $\Fforty$, \Ffortyten, $F_{\text{SPR}=45\%}$,
$F_{\text{SPR}=45\%}$--40:10, and $F_{\text{SPR}=50\%}$ (e.g., \citealt{Dorn1996,
JTC2013}). The above is only a small fraction of the number of management
procedures that have actually been investigated. There have been many other
combinations of data, assessment models, and harvest control rules. In addition
to the cases examined in the assessment documents, there have been many more
requested at review panel meetings.

While there have been many changes to \fishname\ management procedures, each one
has been considered carefully. Available data have changed over the years, and there
have been many advances in the discipline of fisheries science. In some ways,
the latter has evolved considerably over the course of the historical hake
fishery, new statistical techniques and software have evolved (e.g., Bayesian
vs.~maximum likelihood methods) and the scientific literature has
suggested potentially important biological dynamics to consider (e.g., explicit
modeling of length-at-age). Policies requiring the application of
specific control rules have also changed such as the United States' National
Standards Guidelines in 2002 and the \Ffortyten{} harvest control rule
in the Agreement
(see Glossary in Appendix~\ref{chap:glossary}). Analysts making changes to \fishname\ management procedures have been
trying to improve the caliber and relevance of the assessments by responding to
new scientific developments, policy requirements, and different or new insights
during the peer review process. Until the process for a MSE
began, initiated in 2013 \citep{JTC2013} and currently being revisited,
none of these management procedure changes were evaluated by simulation and
quantitatively compared with performance measures.

\subsection{Description of base model}\label{sec:assessment-base-model}

The \Sexpr{assess.yr} base model is predominantly an update of the base model in
the \Sexpr{last.assess.yr} stock assessment.
The statistical-catch-at-age model assumes that the
\fishname\ population is a single coast-wide stock subject to
one aggregated fleet with combined male and female population dynamics.
Stock Synthesis \citep{MethotWetzel2013} version \Sexpr{ss.version} was used.
The largest changes between the
\Sexpr{last.assess.yr} and \Sexpr{assess.yr} stock assessments are the addition of another
year of
acoustic survey and
fishery data, the use of just five recent years (rather than all years) of weight-at-age
data to calculate fecundity-at-age in the forecast period, and the following two structural changes.
A nearly uniform prior (in transformed space) was placed on the
Dirichlet-Multinomial parameters used to weight the age-composition data.
Estimated recruitment deviations were no longer constrained to sum to zero.
% Manual 2020 KFJ

The \Sexpr{assess.yr} base model includes an acoustic data time series from 1995
to \Sexpr{last.survey.year}. Maturity is assumed to be time-invariant and the
maturity ogive updated in 2018 was retained
(see Section~\ref{sec:data-maturity}).
Fecundity is defined as weight-at-age multiplied by the maturity ogive
and is time-varying across years with empirical weight-at-age data (\Sexpr{start.yr.age.comps}--
\Sexpr{last.data.yr}; see Section~\ref{sec:data-weight-at-age}).
The Dirichlet-Multinomial (D-M)
likelihood approach \citep{ThorsonEtAl2017Dirichlet} was again used to estimate the weights
associated with age-composition data, rather than iteratively tuning the sample size multiplier
as in 2017 and earlier assessments (see
Section~\ref{sec:data-age-comp-likelihood}). Time-varying fishery
selectivity is retained in the \Sexpr{assess.yr} base model with the magnitude
of the allowable deviations unchanged from the \Sexpr{last.assess.yr} base model
(see Section~\ref{sec:data-variability-selectivity}).
The general parameterization of
selectivity was retained, although additional parameters were required to
estimate an additional year of deviations. The selectivity of the acoustic survey is
assumed to not change over time. Selectivity curves were modeled as
non-parametric functions estimating age-specific values for each age beginning
at age-2 for the acoustic survey (because age-1 fish are mainly excluded from
the sampling design) and age-1 for the fishery until a maximum age of 6 (all
fish 6 and older have the same selectivity).
% Manual 2020 KFJ

Prior probability distributions are used for a select few parameters
and fixed values are used for several parameters. For the base model, the
instantaneous rate of natural mortality ($M$) is estimated with a
\Sexpr{m.prior[1]} prior having a median of \Sexpr{m.prior[2]} and a standard
deviation (in log-space) of 0.1 (see
Section~\ref{sec:data-natural-mortality}). The stock-recruitment function is a
Beverton-Holt parameterization, with the log of the mean unexploited recruitment
freely estimated. This assessment uses the same Beta-distributed prior for
stock-recruit steepness ($h$), based on \citet{MyersBowenEtAl1999}, that has
been applied since 2011 \citep{StewartForrestEtAl2011, JTC2012, JTC2013,
JTC2014, JTC2015, JTC2016, JTC2017, JTC2018}. Year-specific recruitment deviations were estimated
from \Sexpr{main.recdev.early}--\Sexpr{main.recdev.end}
as well as the years \Sexpr{assess.yr}, \Sexpr{assess.yr+1}, and
\Sexpr{assess.yr+2} for purposes of forecasting. The standard deviation,
$\sigma_r$, of recruitment variability, serving as both a recruitment deviation
constraint and bias-correction term, is fixed at
\Sexpr{base.model$sigma_R_in} in this assessment. This value is based on
consistency with the observed variability in the time series of recruitment
deviation estimates, and is the same as assumed in assessments from 2013 to
\Sexpr{last.assess.yr} (Table~\ref{tab:main-assessment-changes}). Survey
catchability was set at the median unbiased estimate calculated analytically as
per \citet{LudwigWalters1981}.
% Manual 2020 KFJ

Statistical likelihood functions used for data fitting are typical of many stock
assessments. The acoustic survey index of abundance was fit via a log-normal
likelihood function, using the observed (and extra 2009) sampling variability,
estimated via kriging, as year-specific weighting. An additional constant and
additive standard deviation on the log-scale component is included, which was
freely estimated to accommodate unaccounted-for sources of process and
observation error. A Dirichlet-Multinomial (D-M) likelihood was applied to age-composition data,
with input sample sizes equal to the sum of the number of trips or hauls actually sampled across all
fishing fleets or the number of trawl sets in the research surveys (see Section~\ref{sec:data-age-comp-likelihood}).
% Manual 2020 KFJ

Uncertainty of estimated quantities was calculated via Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) simulations. The bounds of 95\% credibility intervals were calculated as
the 2.5\% quantile and the 97.5\% quantile of posterior distributions from the
MCMC simulations, to give equal-tailed intervals. The Stock Synthesis input
files for the base model are given in
Appendices~\ref{chap:data-file}-\ref{chap:weight-at-age-file}.

Calculations and figures from Stock Synthesis output were performed using
\Sexpr{R.Version()$version.string} \citep{R2019} and many R packages (in
particular r4ss and xtable). The use of R, knitr, \LaTeX~and GitHub immensely
facilitated the collaborative writing of this document.
In particular, having most of the code automatically shared since the 2016
assessment \citep{JTC2016} allows for the completion of a full assessment
in the limited time available.
A recent DFO workshop \citep{EdwardsDupliseaEtAl2018} shared such a
`transparent, traceable, and transferable' workflow with a wider audience,
partly motivated by our ongoing \fishname\ assessments.

\subsection{Response to 2019 Scientific Review Group (SRG) review}\label{sec:assessment-response-review}

The Scientific Review Group (SRG) meeting was held from February 19-22, 2019
at the Simon Fraser University Harbour Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada.

The following are the `SRG Recommendations and Conclusions for the Hake Stock Assessment'
from the 2019 SRG report, and associated responses from the JTC:

1. The SRG notes the high sensitivity of the model to the variance parameter assumed for
recruitment deviations ($\sigma_R$, a parameter that is not directly observable). While the spawning
biomass trajectories across values of $\sigma_R$ were very close to one another, the corresponding
estimates of $R_0$ led to widely different estimates of stock status (relative spawning biomass).
The JTC presented evidence that supported the value used in the assessment.
{\bf The SRG encourages the JTC to explore methods for parameterizing recruitment and/or
estimating $\sigma_R$ that would reduce model sensitivity to the value of this constraint.}

% From Issue \#468:
\emph{Response -- Developing best practices for modeling equilibrium recruitment ($R_0$)
  and recruitment variability ($\sigma_R$)
  remain broad topics of contemporary research. The JTC continues to conduct,
  collaborate on, and monitor ongoing research projects concerning
  approaches for advancing recruitment estimation,
  as applied to \fishname\ and in general. We now briefly discuss several of these research
  endeavors.}

\emph{The JTC is conducting and collaborating on simulation projects looking into the concurrent
  estimation of multiple variance parameters. This includes the estimation of variability
  associated with time-varying selectivity, $\sigma_R$, of the extra standard deviation parameters
  on survey index data, and of the Dirichlet-Multinomial parameters $\theta_{\text{fish}}$ and $\theta_{\text{surv}}$.
  Variance parameters in stock assessment models have a tendency to be interrelated
  when they capture other sources of variance attributed to model mis-specification rather
  than variability directly related to the given process.
  This is particularly
  important for $\sigma_R$ because without an index of recruitment to directly inform the
  estimation of $\sigma_R$ it tends to soak up unspecified variability.
  This work is related with other time-varying selectivity research, as discussed in response 2
  below.}

\emph{The near completion of the Management Strategy Evaluation framework for \fishname\ creates
  considerable advantages for examining recruitment. For example, using the Template Model
  Builder (TMB) estimation code developed by Dr. Nis Jacobsen for the MSE, there is opportunity
  to explore random-effects treatment of recruitment variability \citep{Thorson2019}.  The MSE
  framework can also be used to evaluated the robustness of recruitment modeling assumptions on
  management performance and uncertainty.  Further, the MSE could be an additional option for
  estimating $\sigma_R$ in MCMC runs while further testing semi-parametric selectivity.}

\emph{The JTC conducted an analysis looking into autocorrelation of recruitment deviations over
  time. Results showed no indication of autocorrelation, suggesting there is no need to
  add additional variance terms to account for temporally-related recruitment deviations.
  The assessment model is adequately accounting for general life-history traits and includes
  an adequate representation of ageing error. Along with no apparent retrospective pattern
  (see Section~\ref{sec:assessment-retrospective-analyses}), this result suggests that the
  assessment model is not overly mis-specified. Given the lack of autocorrelation, the
  assessment model was not sensitive to the addition of an autocorrelation parameter.}

\emph{The JTC is following work being conducted by Dr. Cathleen Vestfals and colleagues at
  the Northwest Fisheries Science Center looking at identifying climate drivers of
  \fishname\ early life-history stages and recruitment. Possible outcomes from this work
  of direct use to the assessment include the development of an explicit recruitment index,
  an environmental index linked to recruitment, indicators of recruitment variation
  ($\sigma_R$), and indicators of current or forecasted levels of recruitment.
  Related work on making fisheries advice robust to time-varying productivity is
  being conducted at the Pacific Biological Station, as part of a national DFO
  initiative on an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management.}

\emph{The JTC is also following work being conducted by the International Council for
  the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) Methods Working Group which, among other things,
  is looking at meta-analytical approaches for estimating recruitment parameters.  Results
  from this work could be used to develop informative prior distributions on key
  recruitment parameters.}

\emph{The JTC plans to continue to work towards evaluating and testing best practices
  for modeling recruitment variability, including the use of multi-stage recruitment
  functions. In general, many of these issues are widespread
  in stock assessment, and scientific-based solutions are likely to be the result of medium
  to long-term research projects.}

2. The SRG notes that when setting values for other parameters that cannot be estimated
directly with confidence, the choice of values should be made using methods that are
objective, repeatable, and depend on fits to the observed data rather than on the model's
subsequent estimates of biomass or recruitment. One clear example is setting the parameter
controlling time-varying fishery selectivity ($\Phi$), with a goal of establishing repeatable steps
for setting $\Phi$ each year. This year the JTC presented a semi-parametric method of
characterizing the flexibility in selectivity, but this method did not resolve the sensitivity of
results to the choice of $\Phi$. {\bf The SRG recommends that the JTC provide a review of how
time-varying selectivity is parameterized and estimated in other assessments.}

\emph{Response -- Most methods that are available to estimate time-varying selectivity require
subjective choices. Common choices include
which years to model using a time block,
the level of variability to use for a penalized vector, or
the degree of smoothing for a spline.
Alternatively, state-space models can be used estimate time-varying selectivity in two
dimensions, age and time, where the degree of smoothing is estimated \citep{NielsenBerg2014}.}

\emph{A comparison project was recently launched by the
ICES Methods Working Group
to compare the results of four stock assessment frameworks that estimate
time-varying selectivity using different assumptions:
State-Space Assessment Model (SAM),
Woods Hole Assessment Method (WHAM),
Stock Synthesis, and
Age Structured Assessment Program (ASAP). Each framework will be fit to data from 10 stocks
using multiple configurations. This study will allow for the comparison of
estimated trajectories between two state-space frameworks and two well-used
statistical catch-at-age models when time-varying selectivity is ignored or
estimated using the current best practices for each framework. Results will
inform best practices for this assessment in 2021.}

3. The histological analysis of ovaries for maturity presented in 2018 showed a distinct
difference in the percent of Hake that are mature at age 2 and age 3 between areas, with a
greater proportion mature south of Point Conception (34.5$^\circ$N). These data show that there
may be two populations of hake, north and south of this boundary. The SRG also notes that
ovaries collected in Canada were not used to update the maturity ogive. Hake found in
Canada are generally older, and including samples of these fish in the maturity analysis
should improve the accuracy of the maturity ogive. The JTC noted that work began late in
2018 to address this recommendation. {\bf The SRG strongly supports the ongoing genetic
analyses to determine whether there are genetic differences among the two southern
regions and other regions. In addition, the SRG notes that Canadian samples should be
included in the maturity analysis.}

\emph{Response -- The JTC is in communication with the research team conducting \fishname\
genetic analyses. They provided the following update.}

\emph{Genetic samples have been collected from along the Pacific coast during summer,
fall (BC to CA) and winter (OR and CA) and within the Strait of Georgia (BC) during the spring.
We have begun a genetics study to characterize the spatial-temporal population structure
of \fishname\ coast wide. Prior genetic analyses in hake have focused on a smaller geographic
range, over a limited seasonal time scale, and used a limited set of genetic markers
\citep{IwamotoFordEtAl2004, IwamotoElzEtAl2015}.}

\emph{For this study, samples were grouped in boxes based on spatial-temporal collection
information (i.e., year, season, and location) and selected samples distributed across
these boxes. RADseq \citep{BairdEtterEtAl2008, AliORoukeEtAl2016} has been utilized to generate 8,763 genome
wide polymorphic markers, which will allow for powerful population genomic analyses
as well as association tests of genetic variability with life-history characteristics
such as growth rates and age at maturation.}

\emph{In the initial round of sequencing, DNA were extracted from 1,092 individuals from
across spatial-temporal boxes from 2015--2017. Of these, 876 samples were sequenced based
on sufficient DNA concentrations, 667 of which passed quality filters. Preliminary findings
generally corroborate the single stock hypothesis with low differentiation amongst locations.
A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) groups all coastal individuals across space and time together
with Salish Sea individuals clearly distinct. However, using a Bayesian clustering analysis there was
evidence for seasonal migration across several winter boxes (across years and location) showing signs
of differentiation from the same location in different season and years. This was corroborated
with weak but significant pairwise FST comparisons.}

\emph{For the next round of sequencing, and to finalize data collection for the project, the team will
sequence approximately another 1,000 individuals.  These include recently acquired samples, with the goal
of filling in gaps in spatial-temporal boxes (especially from Canada) and to add additional samples to
existing boxes to boost sample sizes. This approach will provide the best picture to date of
\fishname\ genetic population structure. The team expects to complete the sequencing and analyses for these samples
in 2020, culminating in the submission of a peer-reviewed publication.}

\emph{Canadian ovaries from surveys have been collected since 2018 and could be included in
updated maturity analyses planned for the upcoming year. However, logistical considerations
will need to be worked out regarding sample exchange and histological analysis workload
between DFO and NWFSC.}

\emph{A new project has been initiated looking at improved methods to differentiate which females
will likely spawn from those that will not and, thus, should or should not be included as
spawning biomass. The study is using liver and ovary samples collected during NWFSC acoustic surveys
(2017--2019) to develop metabolic markers linked to key female reproductive stages. Liver physiology
and levels of certain lipid classes may reveal overall metabolic and reproductive status.
Preliminary results from initial liver lipid analyses indicate that levels of important structural (phospholipids)
and storage (triglycerides) lipids are indicative of female maturation status (immature vs. mature)
and may be predictive of reproductive failure (atresia) and/or skipped spawning in \fishname. Work is
currently underway to expand the liver lipid analyses and develop molecular markers for lipid synthesis
(liver RNA) and ovarian growth and atresia (ovarian RNA). Molecular information from liver and ovary
samples together with liver lipid analyses and gonadal histology should provide a broader picture of
reproductive status of female \fishname\ and better inform stock assessments.}

4. The issue of data weighting remains a significant technical challenge for stock assessments
that integrate information of different forms (e.g., biomass indices and age compositions)
from different sources (e.g., different fishing sectors). A potential issue related to data
weighting that should be explored in the next assessment is the JTC's approach to deriving
the initial set of data weightings associated with the fishery and survey age-composition
observations. The annual number of at-sea hauls and shore-based trips from which fish ages
were incorporated into the age-composition series are summed to provide initial sample
sizes. If there are changes in the number of fish associated with each sample unit (haul or
trip) over time, then a corresponding change in the information content of an age-
composition sample would be expected. The approach taken to deriving the initial data
weights could account for changes in the number of fish per sampling unit. Alternatively, the
Dirichlet multinomial parameter that accounts for variability in the age-composition
observations could include a time-varying component to account for changes in the number
of fish per sampling unit. {\bf The SRG notes that the JTC included information in the 2019
assessment on the annual numbers of fish underlying each annual age-composition
observation, but were unable to complete an analysis, as requested in the 2018 SRG
report, on the effect of potential changes in sampling protocols that could influence the
input sample sizes. The SRG reiterates its request for this analysis.}

\emph{Response -- Progress was made on documenting the historical methods utilized
to sample \fishname\ for otoliths, which began in the 1970s with observers on foreign vessels.
Many protocols have remain unchanged over time, but some methods of collecting fish for
ageing and the numbers of fish aged per tow or trip have changed. Below, we summarize
known major changes.}

\emph{A clear change in protocol was initiated in 1999 for the U.S. at-sea fishery with the
move towards random sampling of fish for ages rather than random-stratified sampling,
which attempts to collect ages in each 1 cm length bin. Additionally, in 2009
at-sea observers started collecting three instead of five sets of otoliths from a haul.}

\emph{In Canada, target sample size (n=50) has not changed over time for at-sea observers aboard
foreign joint-venture vessels. On domestic vessels observers are currently instructed to
collect age samples from 60 fish, whereas prior to 2001 the target may have only been 50.
This lower target potentially only pertained to shoreside hake vessels before at-sea
observer coverage was discontinued with the installment of electronic monitoring.}

\emph{In 2016, dockside observers were asked to change their protocols based on JTC input.
Samples changed from being collected during dedicated weeks to the landing level.}

\emph{A more complete summary of the changes in the sampling protocol over time will be
completed in the upcoming months and included in the 2021 assessment as an appendix.
Currently, this information has been used to inform a simulation study that investigated
repercussions of biased input sample sizes. Preliminary results suggest
that the D-M parameters combined with time-varying selectivity can estimate the time
series of spawning stock biomass with little bias when there is no temporal trend in
the bias applied to the input sample size. Future investigations will look into temporal
trends in this bias, where the trend will be informed by changes in the protocols used
to specify the collection of otoliths in the \fishname\ fishery.}

5. A recent advance in Bayesian analysis (the no U-turn sampler, NUTS) raises the possibility
that the assessment model could reach convergence much more quickly than is now possible.
Many 2019 sensitivity runs were limited to maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) values,
rather than Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) values, to save computing time, minutes
versus 2.5 days per run, respectively. {\bf The SRG recommends that the JTC continue to
explore NUTS and similar options, as using MCMC for all runs would provide better
comparability between the base assessment model and sensitivity runs.}

\emph{Response -- The JTC evaluated the No U-turn sampler (NUTS) method for conducting efficient
Bayesian MCMC sampling using the {\tt adnuts} R package \citep{Monnahan2018, Monnahan2019}.
Results from this evaluation, including comparisons to the current approach for Bayesian
MCMC sampling, are shown in Appendix~\ref{chap:adnuts}. In addition, the JTC explored
the added utility of using the ShinyStan application {\tt shinystan} features in {\tt adnuts}
to better visualize MCMC diagnostics, including mixing, sampling and divergence metrics, among
other things. A demonstration of this application will be shown at the 2020 SRG meeting. The code
used for running NUTS is given at the end of Appendix~\ref{chap:adnuts}.}

6. Delays in entry and validation of catches reported on paper tickets in Washington and entry
into the PACFIN database was identified as a potential issue. This concern has most often
applied to tribal catches. The preferred process is that all data are available from managed
regional databases in time for JTC data extraction, which usually occurs early in January.
{\bf The SRG recommends that the JTC continue to set a deadline for the extraction of
catch data and be transparent about the sources of data used in the assessment in the
event that data have to be obtained directly from the sources.}

\emph{Response -- The JTC set the deadline 3 January 2020 for the extraction of data.
In addition, the JTC communicated with U.S. State partners to ensure the
most up-to-date data would be available. The streamlining of getting tribal fish
tickets into regional databases is advancing with the recent electronic ticket pilot
study jointly conducted by the Makah Tribe in Washington State and the Pacific States
Marine Fisheries Commission (see the tribal fishery report in
Appendix~\ref{chap:us-fishery-report}). However, nearly
50\% of the tribal catch had yet to be incorporated into the PacFIN regional
database by the data deadline. Nonetheless, the JTC worked with the Makah Tribe and
Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife to ensure the best estimates of
tribal catch were included in the stock assessment, despite not yet appearing in
PacFIN. The JTC anticipates that data will consistently be available in PacFIN
in timely manner moving forward with continued use of electronic ticket reporting
for all tribal catch.}

The JTC also notes that the SRG concurred with our approach in 2019 of using the
long-term averages of time-varying fecundity for years without weight-at-age
data (i.e. before \Sexpr{start.yr.age.comps} and for forecasts). For this assessment
we used the long-term (all data \Sexpr{start.yr.age.comps}--\Sexpr{last.data.yr}) average
for the years prior to \Sexpr{start.yr.age.comps} and the average of the last five years
for the forecast period (\Sexpr{forecast_yrs[1]}--\Sexpr{tail(forecast_yrs, 1)}).

Based on an informal request at the 2018 SRG meeting, we have changed the y-axis
in the historical phase plots (Figures~\ref{fig:es-phase} and~\ref{fig:main-phase})
to show the relative fishing intensity in year $t-1$ (rather than year $t$),
such that the 2020 relative biomass appears on the figure.

Finally, we note that we have complied with the following request from the 2017 SRG
concerning the sensitivity tests to perform in all future assessments:

{\bf The SRG requests that future assessments, beginning with 2018, include the following key
  sensitivity tests: natural mortality, stock-recruit steepness ($h$), $\sigma_r$,
  inclusion of the age-1 index, and exploring the degree of flexibility in time-varying
  selectivity or the $\phi$ parameter, as well as any others the JTC deems appropriate.}


\subsection{Modeling results}\label{sec:assessment-modeling-results}

\subsubsection{Changes from \Sexpr{last.assess.yr} }\label{sec:assessment-changes}

A set of `bridging' models was constructed to evaluate the component-specific
effects of all changes from the \Sexpr{last.assess.yr} base model to
the \Sexpr{assess.yr} base model.

In short, these included the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Update to the latest version of Stock Synthesis, version \Sexpr{ss.version};
  \item Change to estimating a simple vector of recruitment deviations rather
  than a vector of deviations that are constrained to sum to zero;
  \item Update catch data from years prior to \Sexpr{last.data.yr};

The bridging steps can be grouped into three main sets of changes,
with the majority of the steps being those that are performed routinely.
The first step updated the Stock Synthesis framework to follow current best practices.
The second step updated the information available from the fishery.
The third step updated the information available from the survey and implemented
changes to the model structure.

Stock Synthesis version \Sexpr{ss.version} includes
a number of changes since the version used by \citet{JTC2019},
mostly related to forecasting options.
Changes relevant to the assessment of \fishname\ include changes to
increase the convergence of estimates of catchability and parameter deviations,
performance of jitter runs when parameters are near boundary conditions, and
stability of the transition to MCMC when the parameters specifying
bias adjustment of the recruitment deviations are turned off.
Collectively, these changes led to small differences
in estimates of parameter deviations compared to the \Sexpr{last.assess.yr}
base model but essentially no change in the time series (Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel-1}).

We relaxed the constraint that recruitment deviations during the main period sum to
zero. The constraint leads to a mismatch between the MCMC samples that are drawn versus
those that are reported by the MCMC algorithms run through the AD Model Builder software
because AD Model Builder applies the constraint during its
evaluation phase where results are calculated rather than during sampling. This is
a known error and AD Model Builder developers are working on ways to fix this problem.
Until then, best practices suggest removing the constraint such that the sampling and
evaluation algorithms match.

One advantage of using a zero-centered recruitment deviation vector is to
maintain tractability when estimating recruitments, especially for assessments that have
less information about recruitment (little data). The theory behind the use of a zero-centered
recruitment deviation vector is that the $R_0$ and $B_0$ reference points should be reflective of the
central tendency for the time period with the best information about recruitment. A mismatch between
$R_0$ and estimates of recruitment during the data-rich period could,
in theory, lead to a better fit to the indices of abundance or
some other data source which wouldn't otherwise be expected to be informative about recruitment.
However, for \fishname\ the stock assessment is relatively data-rich and the index is pretty
consistent with the recruitments, so such tension doesn't seem to be present.

Estimating recruitment deviations that are not constrained to sum to zero will increase the
compatibility between MCMC and MLE results, and also increase the stability of model results,
because penalties have implications for calculating derivatives. The non-zero centered approach
resulted in a median recruitment deviation distribution of 0.086 in the \Sexpr{assess.yr}
base model. Compared to the \Sexpr{last.assess.yr} assessment, the time series of spawning
biomass and fishing mortality, as well as the fit to the survey index were largely
unchanged. However, relative spawning biomass increased for all years because the estimate of
$\log R_0$ increased and
estimates of recruitment deviations were slightly more positive
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel-1}). Nonetheless, the moderate increase
in relative spawning biomass is well within the uncertainty bounds of models
that apply and do not apply this relaxed constraint.

The second set of bridging steps was conducted to update the fishery-dependent data.
This primarily included minor adjustments in catch, fishery age-composition, and
weight-at-age values.
Historical catches from the Canadian Joint-Venture fishery
that were inadvertently left out of last year's assessment were included.
Also included were additional age data from the U.S. shoreside fleet that were previously
filtered from the analysis because of a lack of delineation regarding
the method used to age the samples.
Weight-at-age data that lack information about the month in which
they were collected are now included.
Samples that were recently aged but not available for the \Sexpr{last.assess.yr}
assessment were included.
These changes to pre-\Sexpr{last.assess.yr} data were small enough that they had
little impact on the model results (Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel-2}).

The addition of \Sexpr{last.data.yr} catch allowed the model to be
extended to the start of \Sexpr{assess.yr}, but the estimates for
\Sexpr{assess.yr} remained highly uncertain
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel-2})
in the absence of additional information about recent recruitment.
Adding \Sexpr{last.data.yr} fishery age-composition and weight-at-age data
had relatively little impact on the historical biomass estimates,
indicating that the observed \Sexpr{last.data.yr} ages were consistent with the model
estimates without those data (Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel-2}).  However,
the addition of these data did alter recent recruitment
estimates, increasing the estimated size of the 2016 and 2017 year classes and
decreasing the 2018 year class.
This bridging step also shifted the ending year of the deviations
in the selectivity parameters from \Sexpr{last.data.yr-1} to
\Sexpr{last.data.yr} because of the additiona of fishery data in \Sexpr{last.data.yr}.

Including the fishery-independent biomass estimate led to a slightly more optimistic
trajectory of the stock over the last couple of years
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel-3}),
which was to be expected given the increase in the
index relative to \Sexpr{penult.survey.year}.
The addition of survey age-composition data led to reduced
uncertainty, particularly for the 2010, 2014, 2016, and 2017 year classes.
The 2010 and 2014 year classes are estimated to be higher in this
assessment than they were in the \Sexpr{last.assess.yr} assessment.
This increase is largely driven by the addition
of the 2019 acoustic survey age compositions
where the proportion of age-9 fish and age-5 fish were higher than what
the \Sexpr{end.yr-1} assessment model would have otherwise predicted
given mortality. The \Sexpr{last.assess.yr} acoustic survey was the first time
the 2016 and 2017 cohorts were adequately sampled (age-2 or older) by the survey,
which is why the uncertainty associated with these cohorts was reduced (though
still quite uncertain; Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel-3}).

The final bridging step involved using the new priors on the D-M parameters
$\theta_{\text{fish}}$ and $\theta_{\text{surv}}$, and explicitly estimating $\theta_{\text{surv}}$
(see Section~\ref{sec:data-age-comp-likelihood}). This resulted
in the \Sexpr{assess.yr} base model (Table~\ref{tab:main-assessment-changes}).
The new priors led to a slight increase in correlation between
estimates of $M$ and $\log R_0$ (Appendix~\ref{chap:mcmc-diagnostics}),
though a decrease compared to the \Sexpr{last.assess.yr} assessment, and effectively no difference in the
trajectory of the stock or estimates of its status
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel-3}).
The settings related to avoiding bias in recruitment estimation,
based on the method proposed by \citet{MethotTaylor2011}, were
also shifted by 1 year to account for the addition of information
about recruitment for the \Sexpr{last.data.yr - 1} cohort.

\subsubsection{Assessment model results}\label{sec:assessment-model-results}
\subsubsub{Model Fit}

For the base model, the MCMC chain length was 24~million as it was in the
\Sexpr{last.assess.yr} assessment \citep{JTC2019}.
The first 4,000,000 values were discarded to eliminate `burn-in' effects and
each 10,000th value thereafter was retained, resulting in \Sexpr{f(num.mcmc.samples)}
samples from the posterior distributions for model parameters and derived
quantities.

Stationarity of the posterior distribution for model parameters was
re-assessed via a suite of standard single-chain and multi-chain diagnostic tests.
The objective function, as
well as all estimated parameters and derived quantities, showed good mixing
during sampling, no evidence for lack of convergence, and low autocorrelation
(results for some key parameters are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-diag-m-r0}
and~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-diag-h-extra-sd}). Correlation-corrected effective sample
sizes were sufficient to summarize the posterior distributions and neither the
Geweke nor the Heidelberger and Welch statistics for these parameters exceeded
critical values more frequently than expected via random chance
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-diag-hists}).
The Gelman-Rubin multi-chain diagnostic test,
which compares within-chain variance to among-chain variance, further indicated that
convergence was adequately achieved (Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-diag-gelrub}).
Correlations among key parameters were
generally low, with the exception of $M$ and $\log R_0$ (Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-pairs}).
Estimates of recruitment in 2010 and 2014 were correlated with
the derived quantity of catch from the default harvest rule in \Sexpr{end.yr},
as to be expected given the dependencies
among these quantities (Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-pairs}). An examination of
deviations in recruitment (log-scale differences between estimated and expected
recruitment values) from recent years
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-pairs-recruit-devs}) indicates the highest
correlation
(\Sexpr{round(cor(base.model$mcmc$Main_RecrDev_2010,base.model$mcmc$Main_RecrDev_2012),2)})
between the 2010 and 2012 recruitment deviations. This continues to be likely
caused by the relative proportion of these two cohorts being better informed by
recent age-composition data than the absolute magnitude of these recruitments.

The new prior for $\theta_{\text{fish}}$ and $\theta_{\text{surv}}$ results
in the estimate (median and 95\% credible interval) for $\log \theta_{\text{fish}}$ of
\Sexpr{log.theta.fishery.median}
(\Sexpr{log.theta.fishery.025},
\Sexpr{log.theta.fishery.975}),
giving an effective sample
size multiplier $\theta_{\text{fish}} / (1 + \theta_{\text{fish}})$
of
\Sexpr{DM.weight.fishery.median}
(\Sexpr{DM.weight.fishery.025},
\Sexpr{DM.weight.fishery.975}).
The new prior results in the survey age-composition parameter being well-sampled
(unlike in the 2019 assessment where it encountered bounds and so was fixed)
with
\protect{$\log \theta_{\text{surv}}$} estimated as
\Sexpr{log.theta.survey.median}
(\Sexpr{log.theta.survey.025},
\Sexpr{log.theta.survey.975}),
and the resulting effective sample
size multiplier $\theta_{\text{surv}} / (1 + \theta_{\text{surv}})$
of
\Sexpr{DM.weight.survey.median}
(\Sexpr{DM.weight.survey.025},
\Sexpr{DM.weight.survey.975}).

The base model fit to the
acoustic survey biomass index (Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-survey-fit})
remains similar to the \Sexpr{last.assess.yr} base model. The \Sexpr{survey.end.yr}
survey biomass estimate resulted in an upward shift in the fit to the
\Sexpr{antepenult.survey.year} and \Sexpr{penult.survey.year} survey data points
and a lengthening of the stable biomass trend over recent years
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-survey-fit}).
The addition of \Sexpr{survey.end.yr} fishery data
had negligible effect on the fit to survey biomass (Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel-2}).
The 2001 data point continues to be well below any model predictions that were evaluated,
and no direct cause for this is known.  The survey did begin earlier that year than all other surveys
between 1995 and 2009 (Table~\ref{tab:main-survey-history}), which may explain
some portion of the anomaly, along with El Ni\~no conditions and age
structure.
The underestimation of the 2009 biomass estimate is much larger
the underestimation of any other year.
The uncertainty of this point (both modeled and actual) is high
because of the presence of large numbers of Humboldt Squid during the
survey. Humboldt Squid have similar TS to hake
which could introduce bias in the biomass estimate for that year, and
which also likely influenced hake population dynamics through predation in that year.

The MLE and median posterior density estimates underfit the 2015 survey
index, overfit the 2017 index, and closely fit the 2019 index (Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-survey-fit}).
This is likely due to slight differences in what the fishery composition data
and survey composition data, when considered independently, would otherwise
suggest as population trends.
Additionally, the population has undergone recent high catch levels and produced
a couple of above-average cohorts that are now mature.

Fits to the age-composition data continue to show close correspondence to the
dominant and small cohorts observed in the data
when the data give a consistent signal
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-age-comp-fits}). Because of the time-varying fishery
selectivity, the fit to commercial age-composition data is particularly good,
although models with time-invariant selectivity used in previous years also fit
the age compositions well.
In the \Sexpr{last.data.yr} fishery, \Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, last.data.yr, 3, cap = FALSE)}.
Age compositions from the \Sexpr{survey.end.yr} acoustic survey suggest a similar age
structure, i.e., \Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, survey.end.yr, 3, cap = FALSE, fleet = 2)}.
Combined, the 2015--\Sexpr{last.data.yr} fishery age-composition data and the
2017--\Sexpr{survey.end.yr} acoustic survey age-composition data
suggest that 2014 was a strong recruitment
year, and the model was able to adequately
fit to these observations (Figure~\ref{fig:main-age-comp-fits}).
The 2016 cohort, which has now been observed twice by the survey,
%\Sexpr{ceiling((survey.end.yr-2016)/2)} times
appears to be smaller than
the 2014 cohort.
The \Sexpr{survey.end.yr} survey was the first to sample the
\Sexpr{survey.end.yr-2} cohort, confirming that
it
was not extremely large (\Sexpr{survey.a2.prop}\% of the \Sexpr{survey.end.yr} survey catch).
Residual
patterns to the fishery and survey age data do not show patterns that would
indicate systematic bias in model predictions
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-age-comp-pearson}).

The MLEs for numbers, biomass,
exploitation rate, and catch (in numbers and in biomass) for each age class in
each year are given in
Tables~\ref{tab:main-est-numbers-at-age}-\ref{tab:main-est-catch-at-age-biomass}.
For the major cohorts, the resulting estimated age-specific catch, natural mortality, and
surviving biomasses are given in Table~\ref{tab:main-cohort-effects}.
For example, the catch weight of the 2014 cohort at age-5 was slightly larger
than that of the 2010 cohort at age-5, but the resulting surviving biomass of
the 2014 cohort was only just over half of the surviving biomass of the 2010
cohort.

Posterior distributions for both steepness and natural mortality are strongly
influenced by priors (Figure~\ref{fig:main-prior-posterior}). The posterior for
steepness is only slightly updated by the data, as expected given the low
sensitivity to steepness values found in previous hake assessments. The natural
mortality parameter, on the other hand, is shifted to the right of the prior
distribution and the prior may be constraining the posterior distribution from shifting
further. Broadening
the prior distribution by increasing the prior standard deviation for the natural mortality
parameter is examined in sensitivity runs (see Section~\ref{sec:assessment-sensitivity-analyses}).
Other parameters showed updating from diffuse priors to stationary posterior
distributions, including $\theta_{\text{surv}}$ (unlike in the 2019 assessment,
as outlined in Section~\ref{sec:data-age-comp-likelihood}).

The \Sexpr{assess.yr} base model specified the same level of variation (standard
deviation of $\Phi = 1.4$) associated with time-varying fishery selectivity as
the \Sexpr{last.assess.yr} base model, effectively
allowing the model flexibility (i.e., a lower penalty on the overall
likelihood) to fit to data that suggests high variability among years for each
age. This level
of variation led to results that were consistent with the \Sexpr{survey.end.yr} acoustic survey
biomass estimate and gave reasonable fits to the fishery age composition data,
while maintaining that there is considerable uncertainty associated with
spatial changes in fish availability (due to movement) and recent
variability in oceanographic conditions. Estimated selectivity deviations for
age-3 and age-4 fish are larger from
2010 to 2012 than in more recent years (Figures~\ref{fig:main-tv-selex}
and~\ref{fig:main-tv-selex-uncertainty}). The median selectivity peaks at age 4
in 2010 and 2012 and at age 3 in 2011 suggesting targeting of the younger cohorts
in those years. This pattern is consistent with the 2008 cohort appearing strong
in the fishery age compositions initially, but decreasing in prominence
from 2013 onward (Figures~\ref{fig:main-age-comp-fits} and
\ref{fig:main-retrospective-recruitment}).
Fishery selectivity on age-2 fish was at its highest
in 2016, followed by 2018.
Fishery selectivity for the most recent year leveled off between ages less
than six even more so than it did for the previous year, suggesting
equal selectivity-at-age for younger ages
Figure~\ref{fig:main-tv-selex-uncertainty}). Even though the
survey selectivity is time invariant, the
posterior shows a broad band of uncertainty between ages 2 and 5
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-tv-selex-uncertainty-lines}). The decline in
survey selectivity between ages 3 and 4 may be an artifact of the interaction
between large cohorts and the biennial timing of recent surveys, with the
2010 and 2014 cohorts occurring at ages 3 and 5 but not age 4.
Fishery selectivity is
likewise very uncertain (Figures~\ref{fig:main-tv-selex-uncertainty}
and~\ref{fig:main-tv-selex-uncertainty-lines}), but in spite of this
uncertainty, changes in year-to-year patterns in the estimates are still
evident, particularly for age-3 and age-4 fish, though these patterns might also
reflect time-varying mortality processes.

\subsubsub{Stock biomass}

The base stock assessment model indicates that since the 1960s, \fishname\
female spawning biomass has ranged from well below to above unfished
equilibrium (Figures~\ref{fig:main-female-spawning-biomass}
and~\ref{fig:main-relative-spawning-biomass} and
Tables~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior} and \ref{tab:main-ci-posterior}). The
model estimates that it was below the unfished equilibrium in the 1960s,
at the start of the assessment period, due to lower than average recruitment.
The stock is estimated to have increased rapidly and was above unfished equilibrium
in the mid-1970s and mid-1980s (after two large recruitments in the early 1980s).
It then declined steadily to a low in 1999. This
was followed by a brief increase to a peak in 2002 as the
very large 1999 year class matured. The 1999 year class largely supported the fishery
for several years due to relatively small recruitments between 2000 and
2007. With the aging 1999 year class, median female spawning biomass declined
throughout the late 2000s, reaching a time-series low of
\Sexpr{median.bio.min}~million~t in \Sexpr{median.bio.min.year}. The assessment
model estimates that median spawning biomass then peaked again in 2013 and 2014 due
to a very large 2010 year class and an
above-average 2008 year class. The subsequent decline from 2014 to 2016 is primarily
from the 2010 year class surpassing the age at which gains in weight from growth
are greater than the loss in weight from mortality.
The 2014 year class is estimated to be large, though not as large as the 1999
and 2010 year classes, increasing the biomass in 2017. The estimated biomass has
declined in each of 2018, 2019 and 2020, during a time of record catches.

The median estimate of the \Sexpr{end.yr} relative spawning biomass (spawning
biomass at the start of \Sexpr{end.yr} divided by that at unfished equilibrium,
$B_0$) is \Sexpr{curr.depl.median}\%. However, the uncertainty
is large, with a 95\%
posterior credibility interval from \Sexpr{curr.depl.lower}\% to
\Sexpr{curr.depl.upper}\% (Tables~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior} and
\ref{tab:main-ci-posterior}).

The median estimate of
the \Sexpr{end.yr} spawning biomass is \Sexpr{curr.bio.median}~million~t (with a
95\% posterior credibility interval from \Sexpr{curr.bio.lower} to
\Sexpr{curr.bio.upper}~million~t). The estimate of the \Sexpr{end.yr-1} female
spawning biomass is \Sexpr{prev.bio.median}
(\Sexpr{prev.bio.lower}--\Sexpr{prev.bio.upper})~million~t. This is a slightly higher
median than the 1.312~(0.471-3.601)~million~t estimated in the \Sexpr{end.yr-1}
assessment, and the credibility interval lies well within that from the \Sexpr{end.yr-1}
assessment.
%%The additional
%%data in the 2018 assessment has reduced the uncertainty of the 2017 biomass, and
%%decreased the median partly due to the impact of the survey biomass estimate.

\subsubsub{Recruitment}

The new data available for this assessment do not significantly change the
estimated patterns of recruitment estimated in recent assessments.
However, estimated recruitments for some years have changed. For example,
this year's median assessment of the 2010 recruitment is
\Sexpr{f((recruitment.med.to.compare - prev.assess.recruitment.med)["2010"], 1)}~billion
more fish (a \Sexpr{f(((((recruitment.med.to.compare - prev.assess.recruitment.med)["2010"]) /
(prev.assess.recruitment.med)["2010"]) * 100), 0)}\% increase) than last
year's assessment. This difference is largely driven by the addition
of the 2019 acoustic survey age compositions (Figure~\ref{fig:main-bridge-5-panel-3})
in which the proportion of age-9 fish in \Sexpr{end.yr} was higher than predicted by the \Sexpr{end.yr-1}
assessment model given mortality.

\fishname\ appear to have low average recruitment with occasional large year-classes
(Figures~\ref{fig:main-recruitment} and \ref{fig:main-recruitment-devs},
Tables~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior} and \ref{tab:main-ci-posterior}).
Very large year classes in 1980, 1984, and 1999 supported much of the commercial
catch from the 1980s to the mid-2000s. From 2000 to 2007, estimated recruitment
was at some of the lowest values in the time-series followed by a moderately
large 2008 year class. The current assessment continues to estimate a very strong 2010 year
class (Figure~\ref{fig:main-numbers-at-age}) comprising
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2013, spec.yr=2010)}\% of the coast-wide commercial catch in 2013,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2014, spec.yr=2010)}\% of the 2014 catch,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2015, spec.yr=2010)}\% of the 2015 catch,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2016, spec.yr=2010)}\% of the 2016 catch,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2017, spec.yr=2010)}\% of the 2017 catch,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2018, spec.yr=2010)}\% of the 2018 catch, and
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2019, spec.yr=2010)}\% of the 2019 catch.
The median estimate of the 2010 year class is
just below the highest ever (for 1980), with a \Sexpr{prob.percent.2010.rec.gt.1980.rec}\%
probability that the 2010 year class is larger than the 1980 year class (this
probability was \Sexpr{prob.percent.2010.rec.gt.1980.rec.last.year.assess}\% for
last year's assessment).

The current assessment also estimates a strong 2014 year class
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-numbers-at-age}) comprising
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2016, spec.yr=2014)}\% of the 2016 catch,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2017, spec.yr=2014)}\% of the 2017 catch,
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2018, spec.yr=2014)}\% of the 2018 catch, and
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2019, spec.yr=2014)}\% of the 2019 catch.
The 2016 cohort also appears to be above average at
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2018, spec.yr=2016)}\% of the 2018 catch, and
\Sexpr{top.coh(base.model, 2019, spec.yr=2016)}\% of the 2019 catch.
Although the absolute size of the 2014 year
class remains uncertain, at least more so than
cohorts that have been observed for more years, five years of fishery data and two years of survey data
suggest that it is a strong year class.  The 2016 year class is
estimated to be above average (similar in size to the 2008 year class) from three years
of fishery data and one year of survey data. The 2017 year class was first observed by the survey in 2019 and
is estimated to be about average in size. Currently, only one year of fishery data is used to estimate the
below-average size of the 2018 year class.

The additional data in the 2019 assessment has increased the median estimate of the
2014 year class to
\Sexpr{recruitment.med.in.2014}~billion fish (Table~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior}),
from the \Sexpr{last.assess.recruitment.med.in.2014}~billion estimated in the 2019 assessment (Table~25 of \citealt{JTC2019}).
The 2014 year class remains the fifth largest estimated recruitment, albeit
with large uncertainty (Table~\ref{tab:main-ci-posterior} and
Figure~\ref{fig:main-recruitment}).  The median estimate for the 2016 year class
is \Sexpr{recruitment.med.in.2016}~billion fish
(\Sexpr{recruitment.lower.in.2016}--\Sexpr{recruitment.upper.in.2016}~billion fish; Tables~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior} and
\ref{tab:main-ci-posterior}).

The model currently estimates small 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2018 year classes (median
recruitment well below the mean of all median recruitments) and near
average 2012 and 2017 year class.  The proportion of the catch that was age-1 fish
in 2019 (2018 year class) was well below that observed in 2018
(2017 year class) and 2017 (2016 year class; Table~\ref{tab:main-all-age-data-fishery}).
% See exec-summary text, and look at this also:
%  years.since.2010.recruitment.med.below.mean
There is little or no information in the data to estimate the sizes of the
\Sexpr{end.yr-1} and \Sexpr{end.yr} year classes. Retrospective analyses of year
class strength for young fish have shown the estimates of recent recruitment to
be unreliable prior to at least age-3 \citep{JTC2013}.

The estimated recruitments with uncertainty for each year and the
overall stock recruit relationship are provided in
Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-sr-variability}. Extremely large variability about the
expectation and about the joint uncertainty of individual recruitment and
spawning biomass pairs are evident. High and low recruitments have
been produced throughout the range of observed spawning biomass
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-sr-variability}). The standard deviation of the time
series of median recruitment deviation estimates for the years 1970-\Sexpr{last.data.yr - 1}, which
are informed by the age compositions, is
\Sexpr{sd.med.recr.dev.estimates}. This value is higher than,
but consistent with, the base model value of \Sexpr{base.model$sigma_R_in}.

\subsubsub{Exploitation status}

Median relative fishing intensity is estimated to have been below
the SPR$_{40\%}$ target for all years
% sort(median.intensity)    % 2017 assessment 1999 was slightly over
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-fishing-intensity} and
Tables~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior} and \ref{tab:main-ci-posterior}).
It was close
to the target in 2008, 2010 and 2011, but harvest in those years did not exceed
the catch limits that were specified, based on the best available science and
harvest control rules in place at the time.
% Also close in 1999 but no TAC then according to landings.vs.tac[34,], so
%  don't mention 1999.
Exploitation fraction (catch divided
by biomass of fish of age-2 and above) has shown relatively similar patterns
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-exploitation-fraction} and
Tables~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior} and
\ref{tab:main-ci-posterior}). Although displaying similar patterns, the exploitation
fraction does not necessarily correspond to fishing intensity because fishing
intensity more directly accounts for the age-structure of both the population and
the catch. Median relative fishing intensity is estimated to have declined from
\Sexpr{median.intensity.2010}\% in 2010 to \Sexpr{median.intensity.2015}\%
in 2015, after which it increased to \Sexpr{median.intensity.2017}\% in 2017 and
has since stayed relatively constant.
The median exploitation fraction decreased from
\Sexpr{exploitation.med.2011} in 2011 to recent lows of
\Sexpr{exploitation.med.2012} in 2012 and
% \Sexpr{exploitation.med.2015} in   % 2012 and 2015 are the same in 2020 assessment
2015,
and then increased to \Sexpr{exploitation.med.2017} in 2017 before ending
at \Sexpr{exploitation.med.penult.yr} in \Sexpr{last.data.yr}.
Although there is a considerable amount of imprecision
around these recent estimates due to uncertainty in recruitment and spawning
biomass, the 95\% posterior credibility interval of relative fishing intensity
was below the SPR management target from 2012 through 2015 (Figure~\ref{fig:main-fishing-intensity}).
The median estimates
for 2016 through 2019 are below the management target, however the 95\% posterior
credibility intervals do include the target level.

% Note that exploitation.med.penult.yr comes out as 0.06, but in Table d
%  is 0.065, because the true value is 0.0648.... The text rounds to two decimal
%  places but Table rounds to three, but rounding is done correctly because of
%  the automation; i.e. we haven't incorrectly rounded up to 0.07, which we
%  could happen from looking at Table d (if the true value wasn't checked). Nice.

\subsubsub{Management performance}

Over the last decade (\Sexpr{end.yr-10}--\Sexpr{end.yr-1}), the mean coast-wide
utilization rate (i.e., landings/quota) has been
\Sexpr{tot.last.10.years.attainment}\% and catches have been below
coast-wide targets (Table~\ref{tab:main-landings-tac}). From \Sexpr{end.yr-5} to
\Sexpr{end.yr-1}, the mean utilization rates differed between the United States
(\Sexpr{usa.last.5.years.attainment}\%) and Canada
(\Sexpr{can.last.5.years.attainment}\%). In 2015, the utilization rate for the
fishery was the lowest of the previous decade
(\Sexpr{tot.2015.attainment}\%) due, in part, to difficulties locating
aggregations of fish and possibly economic reasons.
% Manual done 2020 - check above sentence with
%  landings.vs.tac[landings.vs.tac$Year %in% (end.yr-10):(end.yr-1),10].
Before 2015,
the underutilization in the United States was mostly a result of unrealized
catch in the tribal apportionment, while reports from stakeholders in Canada
suggested that hake were less aggregated in Canada and availability had
declined. In 2016, the utilization rate increased but remained below pre-2015
levels, despite the total 2016 catch being one of the highest of the preceding years.
This is in large part due to increasing catch targets as biomass continues to
increase. The total utilization rate in recent years (2017--2019) has been close to the
average over the last decade. During the last two years, utilization rates have been stable
in both the United States (\Sexpr{usa.last.2.years.attainment}\%) and Canada
(about \Sexpr{can.last.2.years.attainment}\%). Total landings last exceeded the coast-wide quota
in 2002 when utilization was 112\%.

The median relative spawning biomass was
above the $\Bforty$ reference point in all years except 1999 and 2007-2010
(Table~\ref{tab:main-median-posterior} and Figures~\ref{fig:main-relative-spawning-biomass} and~\ref{fig:main-phase}).

These are also shown by phase plot of the joint history of relative spawning biomass
and relative fishing intensity
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-phase}).

%between \Sexpr{median.relative.bio.2007.to.2011.min} and
%\Sexpr{median.relative.bio.2007.to.2011.max}.
Relative spawning biomass increased from the lows in 2007--2010 with
the 2008, 2010, 2014, and 2016 recruitments and, correspondingly, relative fishing
intensity has remained well below target despite recent increases in total catch.
% Relative spawning biomass has been

there is large uncertainty in the \Sexpr{end.yr-1} estimates of relative fishing

joint probility of being both above the target relative fishing intensity in
\Sexpr{end.yr-1} and below the $\Bforty$ relative spawning biomass level at the
start of \Sexpr{end.yr}.

\subsection{Model uncertainty}\label{sec:assessment-model-uncertainty}
 % Manual 2020 done
The base assessment model integrates over the substantial uncertainty associated
with several important model parameters including: acoustic survey catchability
($q$), the magnitude of the stock (via the $\log R_0$ parameter for equilibrium
recruitment), productivity of the stock (via the steepness parameter, $h$, of
the stock-recruitment relationship), the rate of natural mortality ($M$), annual
selectivity for key ages, recruitment deviations, and survey and fishery data
weights (via the Dirichlet-Multinomial parameters
$\theta_{\text{fish}}$ and $\theta_{\text{surv}}$).
The uncertainty portrayed
by the posterior distribution is a better representation of uncertainty than
the asymptotic approximations about the maximum likelihood estimates
(MLEs) because it allows for asymmetry (Figure~\ref{fig:main-prior-posterior};
also see \citealt{JTC2012} for further discussion and
examples).
Note that we use the term MLE even though the priors are involved in the likelihood
calculation and so the more accurate term would be the mode of the posterior density.

Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates} shows that most key derived
quantities from the posterior distribution are larger than their respective MLEs
(e.g., median biomass, recruitment, and relative spawning biomass), however some
parameter estimates (e.g., steepness and catchability) are
smaller. Figure~\ref{fig:main-mle-vs-mcmc} shows the MLE and Bayesian (from
MCMC) estimates as well as the skewed uncertainty in the posterior distributions
for spawning biomass and recruitment for each year. Median estimates of spawning
biomass and recruitment from the posterior distribution are slightly larger than
their respective MLEs. The 95\% credibility (from MCMC) and confidence
(from MLE) intervals overlap considerably, but are by no means identical.

The \fishname\ stock displays a very high degree of recruitment variability,
perhaps the largest of any west coast groundfish stock, resulting in large and
rapid biomass changes. This volatility, coupled with a dynamic fishery that
potentially targets strong cohorts (resulting in time-varying selectivity), and
little data to inform incoming recruitment until the cohort is at least age-2,
will in most circumstances continue to result in highly uncertain
estimates of current stock status and even less-certain projections of the stock
trajectory.

Uncertainty measures in the base model underestimate the total uncertainty in
the current stock status and projections because they do not account for
alternative structural models for hake population dynamics and fishery processes
(e.g., recruitment, selectivity, or spatial fleet or population structure), the
effects of alternative data-weighting choices, and the scientific basis for prior
probability distributions. To address structural uncertainties, the JTC investigated
a range of alternative models, and we present the key sensitivity analyses along with
a suite of other informative sensitivity analyses using maximum likelihood estimation
(Section~\ref{sec:assessment-sensitivity-analyses}).

We also present two appendices, each highlighting Bayesian MCMC results from models with
different structural assumptions or analytical choices compared to the base model.
These include the incorporation
of the age-1 survey index (Appendix~\ref{chap:age1-survey}), and the use of a new analytical tool
for conducting efficient Bayesian MCMC algorithms, the Automatic Differentiation
No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS, \citet{Hoffman2014}), implemented using the
{\tt adnuts} R package \citep{Monnahan2018, Monnahan2019} in
Appendix~\ref{chap:adnuts}. The inclusion of the age-1
survey model was chosen because it may improve estimates of recruitment near the end
of the time series and of age compositions during the forecast period, even though the acoustic
survey design is not structured specifically for indexing age-1 fish. The model that uses the more efficient
{\tt adnuts} package for conducting MCMC
allows comparison with our existing methods, a necessary documented first step
should {\tt adnuts} be used in future \fishname\ assessments.

The JTC continues to be committed to advancing MSE analyses, by coordinating
research with the \fishname\ MSE Working Group and other scientists in the region
engaged in similar research. Incorporating feedback from the
Working Group and stakeholders will ensure that operating models will be able to
provide insight into the important questions defined by interested parties.
Specifically, the development of MSE tools will evaluate major sources of
uncertainty relating to data, model structure and the harvest policy for this
fishery, and will compare potential methods to address them.

\subsection{Reference points}\label{sec:assessment-reference-points}
 % Manual 2020 done.
We report estimates of the base reference points (e.g., $\Fforty$,
$\Bforty$, $\Bmsy$, and MSY) with posterior credibility intervals in
Table~\ref{tab:main-reference-points}. Only those based on $\Fforty$ explicitly
relate to target reference points per the treaty Agreement (see
Section~\ref{sec:intro-management} and Appendix~\ref{chap:glossary}). The
estimates are only slightly different than the estimates in the
\Sexpr{last.assess.yr} assessment (see also Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates}).
% Manual 2020 done.

% Look at dfo.probs.curr and decide what to write. Check that
%   ncol(base.model$risks[[1]]) == 10   (i.e. no new columns added)
% ***Have to update custom-knitr-variables (see UNHARDWIRE in that, when have time).
As part of the DFO Sustainable Fisheries Framework, \citet{DFO2009} defined
a limit reference point as being a biomass
below which serious harm is believed to be occurring to the stock,
and an upper stock reference point above which the stock is considered to be healthy.
These would equate to the Agreement reference points of $\Bten$ and $\Bforty$
(the female spawning biomass being 10\% and 40\%, respectively, of the unfished
equilibrium female spawning biomass).
The probabilities of the female spawning biomass
at the start of \Sexpr{assess.yr} being above each of these points
are P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess.yr}} > \Bten) = \Sexpr{probs.curr.bten}$\% and
P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess.yr}} > \Bforty) = \Sexpr{probs.curr.bforty}$\%
such that the stock is estimated to be in the `healthy zone' (above the upper
stock reference point of $\Bforty$).

With respect to DFO's provisional limit reference point
of $0.4\Bmsy$ and provisional upper stock reference point of $0.8\Bmsy$, the probabilities
are P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess.yr}} > 0.4\Bmsy) = \Sexpr{f(dfo.probs.curr[1, 2], 0)}$\% and
P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess.yr}} > 0.8\Bmsy) = \Sexpr{f(dfo.probs.curr[1, 3], 1)}$\%
such that the stock is estimated to be in the provisional `healthy zone'.
For completeness, we note that P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess.yr}} > \Bmsy) = \Sexpr{f(dfo.probs.curr[1, 1], 1)}$\%

%PFMC refrence points for hake/whiting are: Bmsy = 0.4B0; MSST = 0.25B0.  Will report these as well.
Reference levels of stock status that are used by the U.S. Pacific Fisheries Management
Council (PFMC) include $\Bforty$ and Minimum Stock Size
Threshold (MSST) = $\Btwentyfive$. For \Sexpr{min(forecast_yrs)}, the estimated
posterior median relative spawning biomass is \Sexpr{curr.depl.median}\%, such
that the spawning biomass is above $\Bforty$ and well
above $\Btwentyfive$.
The probability that spawning biomass at the beginning of \Sexpr{assess.yr}
is above $\Bforty$ is
P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess.yr}} > \Bforty) = \Sexpr{probs.curr.bforty}$\% (as noted above), and of being above $\Btwentyfive$
is
P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess.yr}} > \Btwentyfive) = \Sexpr{probs.curr.btwentyfive}$\%.
% $>\Btwentyfive$ = \Sexpr{probs.curr.btwentyfive}\%.


\subsection{Model projections}\label{sec:assessment-model-projections}

The median catch limit for \Sexpr{min(forecast_yrs)} based on the default
\Ffortyten{} harvest policy is \Sexpr{catch.limit.quantiles["median"]}~t, but
has a wide range of uncertainty (Figure~\ref{fig:main-projected-catch-density}),
with the 95\% credibility interval being
\Sexpr{catch.limit.quantiles["lower"]}--\Sexpr{catch.limit.quantiles["upper"]}~t.

Decision tables give projected population status (relative spawning biomass) and
relative fishing intensity under different catch alternatives for the base model
(Tables~\ref{tab:main-decisions-biomass} and~\ref{tab:main-decisions-spr}). The
tables are organized such that the projected outcome for each potential catch
level and year (each row) can be evaluated across the quantiles (columns) of the
posterior distribution. Table~\ref{tab:main-decisions-biomass} shows projected
relative spawning biomass outcomes, and Table~\ref{tab:main-decisions-spr} shows
projected fishing intensity outcomes relative to the 100\% target (based on SPR;
see table legend). Population dynamics and governing
parameters assumed during the forecast period include average recruitment
(no recruitment deviation); selectivity, weight-at-age and fecundity averaged over
the five most recent years (\Sexpr{assess.yr-5}--\Sexpr{assess.yr-1}); and all estimated
parameters constant (at their estimates for each particular MCMC sample).

Relative fishing intensity exceeding 1 (or 100\% when shown as a percentage) indicates fishing in excess of the
$\Fforty$ default harvest rate limit. This can happen for the median
relative fishing intensity in \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[1:(length(forecast_yrs)-1)]}
and \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[length(forecast_yrs)]} because the $\Fforty$ default
harvest-rate catch limit is calculated using baseline selectivity from all
years, whereas the forecasted catches are removed using selectivity averaged
over the last five years. Recent changes in selectivity will thus be reflected
in the determination of overfishing. An alternative catch level where median
relative fishing intensity is 100\% is provided for comparison (catch
alternative g: FI=100\%).

Management metrics that were first identified as important to the Joint Management
Committee (JMC) and the Advisory Panel (AP) in 2012 are presented for
projections to
\Sexpr{forecast_yrs[2:(length(forecast_yrs)-1)]} and
\Sexpr{forecast_yrs[length(forecast_yrs)]} (Tables~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1}
and~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-2} and
Figures~\ref{fig:main-forecast-depletion-comparison}, \ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-1},
and~\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-2}).
These metrics summarize the probability of
various outcomes from the base model given each potential management
action. Although not linear, probabilities can be interpolated from this table
for intermediate catch
values in \Sexpr{assess.yr} (Table~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1} and
Figure~\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-1}). However, interpolation is
not appropriate for all catches in
\Sexpr{assess.yr+1} because catch alternatives~g and~h have catches
that are larger than 500,000~t
% \Sexpr{catch_levels[[5]][[1]][1]}~t
(the constant catch for alternative~e) in \Sexpr{assess.yr} but smaller than 500,000~t
% \Sexpr{catch_levels[[5]][[1]][1]}~t
in \Sexpr{assess.yr+1} (Table~\ref{tab:main-decisions-spr});
this explains why a few probabilities decline
(rather than rise) with increased \Sexpr{assess.yr+1} catch levels in Table~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-2}
and Figure~\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-2}.

Figure~\ref{fig:main-forecast-depletion-comparison} shows the predicted
relative spawning biomass trajectory through
\Sexpr{forecast_yrs[length(forecast_yrs)]} for several of these management
actions. With zero catch for the next two years, the biomass has a probability
of \Sexpr{zero.catch.prob.bio.down.1}\% of decreasing from
\Sexpr{forecast_yrs[1]} to \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[2]}
(Table~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1} and
Figure~\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-1}), and a probability of
\Sexpr{zero.catch.prob.bio.down.2}\% of decreasing from \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[2]}
to \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[3]} (Table~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-2} and
Figure~\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-2}).

% Make consistent with Exec Summary (that has older text commented out for
% possible future use)
The probability of the spawning biomass decreasing from \Sexpr{end.yr} to
\Sexpr{end.yr+1} is over 80\% for all catch levels, including zero
(Table~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1} and
Figure~\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-1}). It is 95\% for the
\Sexpr{end.yr} catch level similar to that for \Sexpr{end.yr-1} (catch alternative~d).
For all explored catches,
the maximum probability of the spawning biomass dropping below $B_{10\%}$ at
the start of \Sexpr{end.yr+1} is 1\%, and of
dropping below $B_{40\%}$ is 40\%
(Table~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1} and
Figure~\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-1}).
It should be noted
that forecasted abundance is not only influenced by catch levels.
As the large 2010 and 2014 cohorts continue to age, their biomass is expected to decrease
as losses from mortality outweigh increases from growth, while the smaller but
above-average and average 2016 and 2017 cohorts will add to overall spawning biomass as they mature.
The below-average 2015 and 2018 cohorts will contribute much less to forecasted spawning
biomass. The probability
that the \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[2]} spawning biomass will be less than the
\Sexpr{forecast_yrs[1]} spawning biomass ranges from \Sexpr{f(min(base.model$risks[[1]][,2]))}\% to \Sexpr{f(max(base.model$risks[[1]][,2]))}\%
depending on the catch level (Table~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1} and
Figure~\ref{fig:main-forecast-risk-comparison-year-1}).


% This needs to be somewhat manual so you can pick the cohorts to
% specify. Increment the years each assessment.
The age composition (in numbers) of the catch in \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[1]} is
projected to be (using MCMC medians)
\Sexpr{fore.catch.prop$Age3}\% age-3 fish from the 2017 year-class,
\Sexpr{fore.catch.prop$Age4}\% age-4 fish from the 2016 year-class,
\Sexpr{fore.catch.prop$Age6}\% age-6 fish from the 2014 year-class and
\Sexpr{fore.catch.prop$Age10}\% age-10 fish from the 2010 year-class
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-age-comp-forecast}). However, those estimates are highly
uncertain with the 95\% credibility interval for the age-6 fraction spanning
\Sexpr{f(fore.catch.prop.age6.lower)}\%--\Sexpr{f(fore.catch.prop.age6.upper)}\%.
Due to the lower average weight at age-3 versus age-10, the median expected
proportion of the \Sexpr{forecast_yrs[1]} catch by weight
is \Sexpr{f(fore.catch.prop.wt.age3.median)}\% for the 2017 cohort
(compared to \Sexpr{fore.catch.prop$Age3}\% by numbers)
and \Sexpr{f(fore.catch.prop.wt.age10.median)}\%
for the 2010 cohort
(compared to \Sexpr{fore.catch.prop$Age10}\% by numbers).

% Manual done 2020.
% Look at dfo.probs.fore and decide what to write. Check which row has the
%  largest catch level (it should be the min prob - look at a decision
%  table to check the catch and then look at dfo.probs.fore). Need to change
%  column heading calls here because years will change.
% Calculations could do with standardising maybe.
With respect to the DFO reference points, even with the largest
\Sexpr{assess.yr} catch of \Sexpr{f(base.model$catch.levels[[8]][[1]][1])}~t given in Table~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1},
at the start of \Sexpr{assess.yr+1} the stock is expected to be above the critical zone with a probability of
P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess.yr+1}} > \Bten)=
\Sexpr{f( 100 - base.model$risks[[1]][8,"Bratio_2021<0.10"], 0)}$\%
and in the healthy zone with a probability of
P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess.yr+1}} > \Bforty)=
\Sexpr{f( 100 - base.model$risks[[1]][8,"Bratio_2021<0.40"], 0)}$\%.
With respect to the DFO provisional reference points (based on $\Bmsy$), the
the stock is expected to be above the provisional critical zone with a
probability of
P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess.yr+1}} > 0.4\Bmsy) = \Sexpr{f(min(dfo.probs.fore[,"SSB_2021>0.4SSB_MSY"]))}$\%,
in the healthy zone with a probability of
P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess.yr+1}} > 0.8\Bmsy) = \Sexpr{f(min(dfo.probs.fore[,"SSB_2021>0.8SSB_MSY"]))}$\%,
and above $\Bmsy$ with a probability of
P$(B_{\Sexpr{assess.yr+1}} > \Bmsy) = \Sexpr{f(min(dfo.probs.fore[,"SSB_2021>SSB_MSY"]))}$\%.

%PFMC refrence points for hake/whiting are: Bmsy = 0.4B0; MSST = 0.25B0.  Will report these as well.
With respect to PFMC stock size reference points, a level of \Sexpr{assess.yr} catch consistent with the Treaty
default harvest control rule (\Sexpr{f(base.model$catch.levels[[8]][[1]][1])}~t) has a \Sexpr{f(base.model$risks[[1]][,3][8])}\% estimated probability of the biomass going below
$\Bforty$ in \Sexpr{assess.yr + 1} (\Sexpr{f(base.model$risks[[1]][,4][8])}\% probability of going below $\Btwentyfive$; Table~\ref{tab:main-risk-year-1}).
That probability decreases to \Sexpr{f(base.model$risks[[1]][,3][4])}\% and \Sexpr{f(base.model$risks[[1]][,4][4])}\%, respectively, if the catch level stays about the same in \Sexpr{assess.yr + 1} as in \Sexpr{assess.yr}.

\subsection{Sensitivity analyses }\label{sec:assessment-sensitivity-analyses}

Sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate influence of data inputs and
structural uncertainty of the base model by investigating how changes to the
model affected the estimated values and derived quantities. For expediency,
almost all
sensitivity analyses compared MLE estimates rather than MCMC
posteriors. Therefore, the values reported below are not directly comparable to
the base model MCMC values reported elsewhere. For a comparison of the base model
MLE estimates, see Tables~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1}--\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-3}.
The sensitivities include the following:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Consideration of a higher standard deviation on the prior distribution
  for natural mortality;

\item Consideration of alternative values for steepness;

\item Assume higher/lower variation about the stock-recruitment curve
  ($\sigma_r$);

\item Include the age-1 survey index as an additional source of information;

\item Use of the McAllister-Ianelli method for data-weighting;

\item Use of the Francis method for data-weighting;

\item Consideration of alternative standard deviations for time-varying
  selectivity;

\item Consideration of an alternative parameterization for time-varying
  selectivity;

\item Removal of cohort-based ageing error from the model; and

\item Running the base model using the Auto-Differentiation No-U-Turn-Sampling algorithm (NUTS, \citet{Hoffman2014}
within the R package {\tt adnuts} (\citet{Monnahan2018}, \citet{Monnahan2019}).

\end{enumerate}


In general, none of the sensitivities resulted in any substantial departure from
the main population dynamics of the base model; all models showed large
estimated increases in spawning biomass in the early- to mid-2010s that continues to be
driven by the 2010 and the 2014 cohorts. The overall scale of the
population was impacted by various alternative assumptions, and the highly
uncertain size of the recent large cohorts were more variable across sensitivity analyses
than earlier cohorts which have been observed for more years.

% Leaving as one long line as easier to comment back in if needed (lots of calcs
% in here). May not be needed anyway.
%%The results of this model relative to the base model are shown in Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-2} and Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-2} and \ref{fig:main-recruitment-base-alternative-2}. In general, the estimated population dynamics are similar, regardless of extrapolation, throughout most of the time series.  However, there is some divergence in recent year estimates; e.g., the estimated relative spawning biomass in \Sexpr{end.yr} is \Sexpr{f(100*sens.models.2.for.table[[1]]$derived_quants["Bratio_2016","Value"],1)}\% for the base model (with extrapolation) and \Sexpr{f(100*sens.models.2.for.table[[2]]$derived_quants["Bratio_2016","Value"],1)}\% for the model without extrapolation. The 2016 default harvest control catch limit coming from the base model is \Sexpr{f(sens.models.2.for.table[[1]]$derived_quants["ForeCatch_2016","Value"])}~t compared to \Sexpr{f(sens.models.2.for.table[[2]]$derived_quants["ForeCatch_2016","Value"])}~t for the model using no extrapolation (using MLE values).

% MLE added to emphasise why numbers are different to usual (MCMC) base model
% ones.
% even though this is generlaized, it is not very general since the index
% number of the list is used

Several key underlying structural model assumptions were identified that have
persisted across many previous hake assessments, and thus warrant revisiting
periodically as a set of reference sensitivity examinations to new base models.
Those identified here (as noted above) include the specification of natural mortality, the level
of variation assumed about the stock-recruitment relationship ($\sigma_r$), and
the resiliency of the stock in terms of recruitment (steepness).

The standard deviation of the prior distribution on natural mortality was

estimates of natural mortality increased from

standard deviation of 0.1) to
\Sexpr{f(sens.models.1[[which(sens.model.names.1=="Natural Mortality (SD=0.3)")]]$parameters["NatM_p_1_Fem_GP_1", "Value"], 3)}
for the sensitivity run with the prior standard
deviation set to 0.3 (Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1}). In addition to allowing a higher estimated value for
natural mortality, the broader prior on $M$ also increased the overall scale of
the population, the estimated stock status relative to $B_0$, and the
uncertainty in spawning biomass on both absolute and relative scales
(Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1} and Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-1}
and~\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-1}).

% section below on steepness sensitivity
% Manual 2020 done
The mean of the prior distribution on steepness was decreased from 0.777 (base)
to 0.5 and, separately, steepness was fixed at 1.0. The decrease in the mean of the
prior resulted in a change in the maximum likelihood estimate of steepness from
\Sexpr{f(base.model$parameters["SR_BH_steep","Value"],3)} to
\Sexpr{f(sens.models.1[[which(sens.model.names.1=="Steepness Mean Prior Low (0.5)")]]$parameters["SR_BH_steep","Value"],3)}
(Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1}).
However, neither steepness
sensitivity analysis had a strong impact on the overall model results
(Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-1} and
\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-1}). The small influence of steepness on
model results is related to the relatively large $\sigma_r$ value which allows
the recruitments to deviate far from the underlying stock-recruit relationship
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-mcmc-sr-variability}).

% section below on sigma_r
% Manual 2020 done
The value of $\sigma_r$ was changed from a value of 1.4 (base) to alternative
high (1.6) and low (1.0) states. The low value, $\sigma_r = 1.0$,
resulted in a model where the standard deviation of the MLE estimates of
recruitment deviations in the period with the most informative data was
\Sexpr{f(sens.models.1[[which(sens.model.names.1=="Sigma R 1.0")]]$sigma_R_info$SD_of_devs[1], 2)},
suggesting that the data were inconsistent with the lower value of $\sigma_r$.
The high value, $\sigma_r = 1.6$, resulted in a model with a more
consistent standard deviation for the estimated recruitment deviations, at
\Sexpr{f(sens.models.1[[which(sens.model.names.1=="Sigma R 1.6")]]$sigma_R_info$SD_of_devs[1], 2)}.
However, the high $\sigma_r$ model had a larger difference between the
spawning biomass at unfished
equilibrium and the spawning biomass at the initial year of the model
than the low $\sigma_r$ model
(Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1} and
Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-1} and
\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-1}). The method of \citet{MethotTaylor2011}
considers a combination of the variability among the
estimated deviations and the uncertainty around the estimates using the formula
\eb
\sigma_r^2 = \mbox{Var}(\hat{r}) + \overline{\mbox{SE}({\hat r}_y)}^2,
\ee
where $\mbox{Var}(\hat{r})$ is the variance among deviations and
$\mbox{SE}(\hat{r}_y)$ is the standard error of each estimate. It
produced a suggested
$\sigma_r$ of \Sexpr{sigma.r.alt.allyr}, which was similar to the
base-model value of 1.4.

% Manual 2020 done
The sensitivity of the base model to the inclusion of the age-1 survey index
provides an additional source of information about the recruitment of different
year classes (see discussion in Section~\ref{sec:data-acoustic-survey}), which
can be particularly useful for the most recent years when little information on
cohort strength is otherwise available. Compared to the base model, estimates
of spawning biomass throughout most of the time series are similar, but do
diverge near the end of the time series
(Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1};
Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-2} and
\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-2}; \Sexpr{end.yr} estimates are
\Sexpr{f(100*sens.models.1.for.table[[1]]$derived_quants[paste0("Bratio_", assess.yr),"Value"],1)}\%
of unfished biomass for the base model and
\Sexpr{f(100*sens.models.1.for.table[[8]]$derived_quants[paste0("Bratio_", assess.yr),"Value"],1)}\%
for the age-1 index model). This change is likely due to the base model
overfitting the age-1 index estimates of the size of the 2005 and 2012 cohorts
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-age-one-index}). These changes are subtle
because the base model generally tracks the trends in the age-1 index well.
Including the age-1 index led to a worse fit to the 2017 acoustic
survey estimate and a better fit to the 2019 estimate compared to the
base model (Figure~\ref{fig:main-index-base-alternative-2}).

% section below on composition weighting
% Manual 2020 done
The sensitivity of the use of the
Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood, implemented in 2018,
which uses two estimated
parameters to automatically weight each of the fishery and survey age
compositions, has now been implemented in the base model. The base model was compared to the
models that used the McAllister-Ianelli and Francis methods.
Both sensitivity methods require manual iterative adjustments to the input sample sizes
using a derived multiplier.
The McAllister-Ianelli method, which was used in assessments prior to 2018,
attempts to make the arithmetic mean of the input
sample size approximately equal to the harmonic mean of the effective
sample size.
The Francis method attempts to make the fit of the expected mean age
lie within the uncertainty intervals at a rate which is consistent
with variability expected based on the adjusted sample sizes.
The Dirichlet-Multinomial method
estimated higher weights on the age compositions but
generally very similar results to the McAllister-Ianelli method.
The McAllister-Ianelli method led to increased uncertainty in estimates of
early recruitments compared to other weighting methods
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-recruit-base-alternative-2}).
The Francis method increased the weighting of the fishery
composition data resulting in a similar time series of biomass, though
slightly reduced in scale. As noted in Section~\ref{sec:data-age-comp-likelihood},
the Francis method is known to be sensitive to outliers and prone to convergence
issues when selectivity is time-varying, as it is in this assessment.

% The influence of an alternative approach for calculating the 2017 fishery age
% composition was also explored. In most years,
% nearly all the available \fishname\ otoliths caught in U.S. waters are aged and then
% used, along with data from Canada, to develop an annual age composition for
% the fishery (see Section~\ref{sec:data-fishery-biological-data}). High catch levels in 2017, resulting
% from high estimates of abundance and associated TACs, and it being a survey year has
% led to an increase in the total number of otoliths sampled for ageing.  For 2017,
% nearly 77\% (2,369 out of 3,090) of the U.S. at-sea sectors otoliths were aged in time
% for this assessment (typically greater than 95\% are aged).  Recently, the
% seasonality of catch-at-age has become even more apparent with the large 2010 and 2014 cohorts, resulting in
% younger individuals being caught in larger proportions later in the year. This can lead
% to bias when the unread otoliths are also from later in the year when aggregating to a single annual
% age composition. In response, the JTC calculated a monthly catch weighted
% annual composition for the U.S. at-sea sectors, and then combined that with the compositions
% from other sectors following standard procedures \citep{JTC2013, JTC2014}. The result
% was minor differences in the overall fishery age composition (Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1}):
% less than a 0.4\% change for
% all ages except the 2014 cohort (increase 2.1\%) and the 2010 cohort (decrease 1.0\%).
% These relatively minor differences also had little to no influence on estimates of spawning
% biomass (Figure~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-2}) or stock status
% (Figure~\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-2}) in 2018. Nonetheless, otolith
% subsampling protocols should be developed to account for seasonality in catch-at-age.  Such
% protocols are especially critical during survey years or years of high abundance when large
% sample sizes are expected or when ageing laboratory resources are limited.

% which was too small to make a noticable impact in the time series of spawning biomass
% (Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-2} and

% section below on selectivity
% Manual 2020
Two types of alternative setups for selectivity were explored in sensitivity
analyses: alternative values of the $\Phi$ parameter
controlling the degree of flexibility of annual variation in the
fishery selectivity and an alternative ``semi-parametric''
parameterization of the time-varying selectivity
(Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-4}-\ref{fig:main-index-base-alternative-4}).

% Removed by KFJ in 2019
% Fishery and survey selectivity in the base model is modeled as changing
% from each age to the next up to age 6 beyond which it is assumed constant.
% Three alternative maximum selectivity age values (5, 7, and 10) were considered to
% investigate the
% asymptotic properties of fishery and survey selectivity patterns and the impact
% maximum selectivity age has on model behavior. For each alternative option
% all of the ages with estimated fishery selectivity had annual deviations
% estimated for the corresponding parameters. Thus, a change from age-6 to
% age-7 as the maximum selectivity age was associated with 29 additional
% parameters, 1 each for the additional age in the fishery and the selectivity
% % parameter counts below aren't dynamic
% and 27 deviations for the years 1991 to 2017.

% The estimated population trends
% throughout the time series are similar, irrespective of maximum selectivity age
% (Figures~\ref{fig:main-base-alternative-3}-\ref{fig:main-index-base-tv-increase-1}).
% However, absolute levels of
% spawning biomass are different, particularly for the age-10 case. Under all
% alternatives, the base model pattern of a decline in survey
% selectivity between ages 3 and 4 remained, and was either increased or repeated
% at additional ages (Figure~\ref{fig:main-base-alternative-3}).
% As noted in Section~\ref{sec:assessment-model-results}, a potential
% cause of this zig-zag pattern is the
% interaction of the biennial timing for much of the survey history with large
% cohorts. The 1999 cohort made up the majority of the observed ages in the survey
% when they were age 2, 4, 6, and 8, while the 2010 and 2014 cohorts have
% primarily been observed when they were age 3, 5, or 7. Thus, any
% differences in the dynamics of these cohorts that are not represented in the model,
% such as differences in natural
% mortality, would lead to a shift
% in selectivity between the even- and odd-numbered ages.
% The choice of age 6 as the maximum was retained in the base model as it
% was more flexible than the choice of age 5 while those with higher ages
% produces less plausible patterns of selectivity.

The consideration of alternative standard deviations ($\Phi$) for time-varying
selectivity is discussed earlier in
Section~\ref{sec:data-variability-selectivity}. Changing the values of the
parameter $\Phi$ controlling the flexibility in time-varying selectivity from
the base model value of $\Phi = 1.40$ to alternative values of 0.21, 0.70, and 2.10,
did not appreciably influence the estimates, or precision, associated with recruitment
in 2014 (Figure~\ref{fig:main-recruit-base-alternative-4}).
However, recruitment estimates for 2017 are linked to the choice of $\Phi$, where the
model with the smallest $\Phi$ at 0.21 estimates the 2017 recruitment deviation as
the highest of the $\Phi$ sensitivity models (Figure~\ref{fig:main-recruit-devs-base-alternative-4})
and provides the worst fit of the most recent survey biomass estimate
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-index-base-alternative-4}).

The alternative ``semi-parametric'' setup for selectivity based on the work of
\citet{Xu2019} differs from the status-quo approach in that the deviations
are applied to the resulting selectivity estimates, not to the original
parameters, and the resulting selectivity ogive is no longer constrained
between 0 and 1 (Figure~\ref{fig:main-selectivity-illustration}). That is,
the deviations are no longer applied as shown in equation (4), but as
exponential multipliers on the baseline selectivity
\eb
S_{ay} = S_a \cdot \exp(\epsilon_{ay})
\ee
where the $S_{ay}$ are derived as described in equations (1)-(3), the
$\epsilon_{ay}$ are the selectivity deviations, $\sigma_s$ is
the parameter which controls the variability in the deviations
(equivalent to $\Phi$ in the base model parameterization), and the
likelihood contribution for the $\epsilon_{ay}$ parameters is
from treating the deviations as normal random variables with
standard deviation $\sigma_s$, $N(0, \sigma_s)$.

This alternative parameterization was expected
to reduce correlation among the deviation
parameters, because a positive deviation at a younger age no longer leads to
a rescaling of the selectivity pattern at all ages.

%Where do we find the following info? For 2020, I just manually looked in model folder, file covar.sso
% or ss.cor
%should reference a table showing correlations of these parameters - corr table is HUGE!
Indeed, there are no
pairs of time-varying selectivity deviation parameters with correlations
above 0.7 or below -0.7 in the semi-parametric model that most closely
matched the base model. This is in contrast to the base model, which had
38 pairs with correlations above 0.7 or below -0.7.
% The Laplace method of
% \citet{ThorsonHicksEtAl2014} also provided an estimate of the
% variance parameter for the semi-parametric selectivity,
% at $\sigma_s = 0.695$, which provided more plausible results than when this
% method was applied to the status-quo selectivity setup.

Both models with alternative $\sigma_s$ parameters ($\sigma_s = 0.695$ and $\sigma_s = 1.0$)
had higher estimates of 2016 and 2017 recruitment compared to the base model,
and the $\sigma_s = 0.695$ model had a visibly worse fit to the recent survey biomass
estimates (Figures~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-4}-\ref{fig:main-index-base-alternative-4}).
Relying on the subjective choice of $\sigma_s = 1.0$ removed one of
the potential benefits of the semi-parametric approach. Given that an MCMC
chain of 24-million samples has been adequate to overcome the inefficient
sampling caused by high parameter correlations in past assessments,
the parameter selectivity was kept as before for this assessment.

% Manual 2020 done
The impact of assuming a time-invariant ageing error vector instead of a
cohort-based ageing error matrix (as in the base model) was evaluated.  The
largest changes to model results are associated with estimates of equilibrium
unfished biomass (Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-3} and
Figure~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-5}) and thus relative spawning biomass
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-5}). These differences stem from
the population model being restricted in the time-invariant case to fitting
age-composition data with a stationary level of measurement error associated
with each age.

The impact of using the adnuts MCMC algorithm is discussed in detail in
Appendix~\ref{chap:adnuts}.

Any additional sensitivity runs arising from the Scientific Review Group
meeting to be held from 25th February to 28nd February 2020 will be documented
in Appendix~\ref{chap:srg-requests} and briefly summarized here.

% 2019 SRG -
%%**Several additional sensitivity runs were completed in response to SRG requests
%%during the Feb 13-16, 2017 meeting in Vancouver, B.C., Canada (see
%%Appendix~\ref{chap:srg-requests}).  These include model sensitivity to the
%%standard deviation associated with time-varying selectivity, further inclusion
%%of the age-1 index, and model convergence diagnostics when using a longer MCMC
%%chain.

%%Several key underlying structural model assumptions were identified that have persisted across many previous hake assessments, and thus warrant revisiting periodically as a set of reference sensitivity examinations to new base models.  Those identified here include the specification of natural mortality, the level of variation assumed about the stock-recruitment relationship ($\sigma_r$), and the resiliency of the stock in terms of recruitment (steepness).  The sensitivity of the base model to changes in the input $\sigma_r$ and to the prior distributions for natural mortality and steepness were explored.  The standard deviation of the prior distribution on natural mortality was increased from 0.1 (as in the base model) to 0.2 and 0.3.  The mean of the prior distribution on steepness was decreased from 0.777 (base) to 0.500, and steepness was also fixed at 1.0.  The value of $\sigma_r$ was changed from a value of 1.4 (base) to alternative high (2.0) and low (1.0) states.  These key sensitivities had little effect on the overall estimated population trend throughout the time series (Figure~\ref{fig:main-biomass-base-alternative-1}), but they do have a significant impact on the estimated scale of the population (quite different estimates of $B_0$ and $R_0$ parameters; Table~\ref{tab:main-parameter-estimates-sens-1}).  The least influential in terms of relative spawning biomass (Figure~\ref{fig:main-status-base-alternative-1}) as compared to the base model is fixing steepness to 1.0, changing the prior mean on steepness, and moderately changing the prior standard deviation on natural mortality (0.2).  The greatest difference in stock status compared to the base model results from changing the input for $\sigma_r$.  Estimates of natural mortality increased from 0.215 for the base model (prior standard deviation of 0.1) to 0.250 for the sensitivity run with the prior standard deviation set to 0.3.  When the mean of the prior distribution for steepness was changed from 0.777 (base model) to 0.5, the estimate for steepness decreased from 0.861 to 0.602.

\subsection{Retrospective analyses}\label{sec:assessment-retrospective-analyses}

Retrospective analyses were performed by iteratively removing the terminal
years' data and estimating the parameters under the assumptions of the base
model. Models with 4, 5, or 6 years of data removed had information
available regarding the large 2010 year class, but did not yet have information on the
2014 year class (Figure~\ref{fig:main-biomass-recruitment-retrospective}). Models
with 1 and 2 years of data removed were just beginning to receive data on age-3 and age-2, respectively,
individuals to predict the size of the 2014 year class.  The base model now has
\Sexpr{number.to.word(assess.yr - 2014 - 1)} years of data to estimate the size of
the 2014 cohort, and the uncertainty around this
estimate has been considerably reduced compared to three years ago
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-biomass-recruitment-retrospective}).

Overall, there is little retrospective change to the relative spawning biomass
trajectory up to the mid-2010s, and most retrospective change occurs in the
final years of the retrospective model
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-biomass-recruitment-retrospective}).
In the previous assessment, the retrospective bias was predominately positive
in these terminal years. In this assessment the bias is a mix of both positive
and negative biases with no systematic pattern indicating that the model is
more correctly specified than one that shows a pattern.

Cohort strength is not well estimated until several ($\sim$4-9) years of fishery
catch-at-age data and survey age-composition data have been collected
(Figure~\ref{fig:main-retrospective-recruitment}).
Deviations for the 1999 and 2010 cohorts, which are the largest cohorts,
exhibit the largest positive biases, and the sizes of several cohorts
(particularly the large 2010 and 2014 cohorts) increase
with the final year of data.
Estimated recruitment deviations for the 2014 cohort appear to be
similar to other large cohorts (1999, 2008, and 2010); although, as more
data becomes available to inform the strength of this cohort,
it appears to maybe be more similar to the 2008 cohort rather than the 1999 cohort.
The variability among cohort estimates relative to their estimated size
in the base model (Figure~\ref{fig:main-relative-retrospective-recruitment})
further indicates that the estimates can start to improve as early as age-3, but
some estimates of cohort strength may not stabilize until
the cohort approaches an age upward of 7 years old.
The lack of systematic bias in the assessment results could be because
both of the largest cohorts are now older than 7 years old.
This illustrates that multiple observations of each cohort are needed in
order to more accurately determine their recruitment strength.

A comparison of the actual assessment models used in each year since
\Sexpr{min(assessment.history$Year)} is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:main-historical-assessments}. There have been substantial
differences in the structural assumptions of the models and,
thus, results submitted each year.
The variability between model results, especially early on in the time
series, is larger than the uncertainty (95\% credibility interval) reported from
any single model in recent years.
Prior to 2004, survey catchability was fixed at 1.0 and this assumption was
heavily investigated between 2004 and 2007, leading to variability in model results
because of the use of several different, but fixed, survey
catchability. Since 2008, catchability has been freely estimated by the model.
The fixing of survey catchability had the effect
of driving the estimate of initial biomass upward, which in turn scaled the
entire biomass trajectory up, leading to higher estimates of relative spawning
biomass than in more recent assessments. The median estimates of
spawning biomass for recent years have remained similar to the previous
assessment but declined relative to the 2015-2017 assessments.
The difference is most likely related to the recent under-fitting of the 2017 survey estimate
of biomass despite the consistency in the structure of the assessment model in
recent years.
The uncertainty interval associated with the \Sexpr{end.yr} assessment brackets the majority of the
historical estimates.
