# MCMC Diagnostics
## Diagnostics: Summary
* Summary diagnostics for key parameters are shown in Appendix A of the
  assessment document
* Additional diagnostic evaluations were performed using the ShinySTAN
  application, an analysis and visualization GUI for MCMC, including:
  - Effective sample sizes for all parameters
  - Number and location of divergent transitions in parameter space for
    all parameters
  - Multiple chain comparison statistics (Rhat)
  - Many others
* Posterior correlations among key parameters and summary diagnostics for
  all chains combined are shown in Appendix A (no issues identified)

## Diagnostics for all parameters and spawning biomass
