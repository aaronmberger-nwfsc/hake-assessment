# Summary
## Summary -- Biomass
* Assessment model continues to fit the age data particularly well
* The median estimate of the `r end_yr` relative spawning biomass
  is `r curr_depl_median`% but is highly uncertain (with 95%
  interval from `r curr_depl_lower`% to `r curr_depl_upper`% )
* The median estimate of the `r end_yr` female spawning biomass
  is `r curr_bio_median` million t (`r curr_bio_lower` to `r curr_bio_upper` million t)
* Recruitment in 2020 and 2021 are still estimated to be above average


## Summary -- Key Points
* Coast-wide catch continues to decline since the time series high in 2017 (to
  39% of the 2017 catch)
* Catch in Canada has steadily declined since 2018, to a very low 3,928~t in 2024
* High proportion of age-4 and age-3 fish in `r end_yr-1` fishery
* These above-average 2020 and 2021 cohorts continue to mature, entering into the
  spawning biomass in 2025
