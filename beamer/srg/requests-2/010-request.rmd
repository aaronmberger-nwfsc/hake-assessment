## Request 1 -- "No unsexed weight-at-age data"

The SRG requests rerunning the GLM for weight-at-age without unsexed hake, and creating a weight-at-age matrix using the updated outputs by averaging Males and Females equally. 

* The GLMM was reran after filtering the data to remove sex.
* The model output was truncated to just produce males and females given unsexed fish were no longer in the data used to fit the GLMM.
* Results for males and females were averaged.
* The weight-at-age file for SS3 was updated.
* The updated weight-at-age file was used to process the fishery-composition data.
