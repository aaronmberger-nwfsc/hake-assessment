## Request 6 -- "New executive summary"

The SRG requests a new executive summary based on the updated base model.

* Done.
* The forecast for a constant catch of 270,000 t was removed and the
  TAC from 2022 (545,000 t) was added. This results in the row letters
  being different for roughly half of the forecast catch streams in the
  tables when compared with the submitted pre-SRG Executive Summary

* The One-page summary has been modified, in particular the last bullet point

* Retrospectives still running - we can show the squid plot once they are done

* Sensitivities not updated
