## Request 4 -- "Clean vs mixed species survey trawls"

In 2023 the acoustic-trawl survey had 13 regions out of 282 that were
classified as hake mix. These regions were associated with 4 separate
trawls. The hake percentages in those hake mix trawls ranged from 55%
to 76% hake (all mixed with rockfish).

22.9 kmt out of the 735 kmt of unkriged biomass (3.1%) came from hake
mixes in 2023.
