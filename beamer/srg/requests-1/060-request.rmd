## Request 6 -- "Down weight the age-composition sample sizes"

A lambda value of 0.05 was multiplied by the age-composition likelihood
component to calculate the overall negative log likelihood to be minimized.

```{r plot-base-v-lambda-ssb, eval = FALSE}
m_names <- c("base", "lambda 0.05")
lambda_model <- readRDS(
  fs::path(
    models_dir, "05-test-models",
    "30-lambda-comps", "30-lambda-comps.rds"
  )
)
plot_biomass(list(base_model, lambda_model), model_names = m_names)
```
