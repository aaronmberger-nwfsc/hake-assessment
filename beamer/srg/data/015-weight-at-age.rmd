# Weight-at-age
## Weight-at-age data
* Pre-1975 U.S.~weight-at-age data are not included because they were
collected from the Puget Sound.
* Historical fecundity uses mean weight-at-age data from all years.
* Future fecundity uses mean weight-at-age data from most recent five years.

## Weight-at-age by year
```{r wt-at-age, fig.height = 4, out.height = "3in", out.width = "1\\columnwidth"}
plot_weight_at_age(wt_at_age,
                   ages = 2:10,
                   bold_ages = 5,
                   cols = c("purple",
                            "darkblue",
                            "yellow",
                            "darkgreen"),
                   max.overlaps = 15)
```

## Sample sizes of weight-at-age by year
```{r main-weight-at-age-numbers, fig.height = 4, out.height = "3in", out.width = "1\\columnwidth"}
plot_heatmap_sample_size_weight_at_age(
  base_model,
  cell_font_size = 2,
  sample_size_df = weight_age_sample_sizes_df,
  pre_yrs = start_yr_age_comps:base_model$endyr,
  pre_func = mean,
  post_yrs = (base_model$endyr - 4):base_model$endyr,
  post_func = mean,
  cols = c("purple",
           "lightgreen",
           "yellow",
           "dodgerblue"),
  ax_tick_font_size = 6)
