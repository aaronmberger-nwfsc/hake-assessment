# Overview

## Overview

1. Sensitivity models:
    - Alternative assumptions for steepness (*h*),
    - Alternative standard deviations for recruitment ($\sigma_r$),
    - Remove the age-1 index,
    - Down-weight fishery age-composition data,
    - Alternative standard deviations for time-varying selectivity ($\Phi$),
    - Alternative prior distributions and parameterizations for natural mortality (*M*),
    - Using the middle of the year to predict maturity-at-age, and
    - Adding a relative index of abundance based on environmental-DNA,


2. Retrospectives `r length(retrospective_yrs)` years into the past

3. Spawning biomass estimates from `r assess_yr - 1991 + 1` years of assessments

**All models were run using MCMC**
