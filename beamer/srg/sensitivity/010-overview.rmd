# Overview

## Overview

1. Sensitivity models:
    - Alternative assumptions for steepness (*h*),
    - Alternative standard deviations for recruitment ($\sigma_r$),
    - Remove the age-1 index,
    - Downweight fishery age-composition data,
    - Alternative standard deviations for time-varying selectivity ($\Phi$),
    - Adding a relative index of abundance based on environmental-DNA,
    - Alternative prior distributions for natural mortality (*M*),
    - Using the middle of the year to predict maturity-at-age, and
    - Assuming natural mortality is specific to ages 0-1, 2, 3, 4, and 5+.

2. Retrospectives `r length(retrospective_yrs)` years into the past

3. Spawning biomass estimates from `r assess_yr - 1991 + 1` years of assessments

4. Hindsight performance of past projections

5. Conveying recruitment uncertainty

**All models were run using MCMC**
