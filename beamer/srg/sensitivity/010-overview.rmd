# Overview

## Overview

1. Sensitivity models:
  - Alternative assumptions for steepness (*h*)
  - Alternative assumptions for natural mortality (*M*)
  - Alternative standard deviations for recruitment ($\sigma_r$)
  - Remove the age-1 index
  - Downweight fishery age-composition data
  - Alternative standard deviations for time-varying selectivity ($\Phi$)

2. Retrospectives `r length(retrospective_yrs)` years into the past

3. Spawning biomass estimates from `r assess_yr - 1991 + 1` years of assessments

4. Hindsight performance of past projections

5. Conveying recruitment uncertainty

**All bridging, sensitivity, and retrospective models were run using MCMC**
