# Summary

## Summary

* In general, sensitivities show no significant departure in population
  dynamics from base model
* Absolute scale changes for some sensitivities, mostly due to differing
  *R*~0~ estimates
* Overall pattern is consistent -- large increases in biomass in early
  2010s and current increase in biomass due to 2020 recruitment
* Retrospective squid plots show that since `r assess_yr - 11`, and
  based on medians:
  - 2014 cohort is the largest
  - 2020 cohort is the second largest
  - 2020 cohort looked a little larger at age-2 than 2016 did, but
    somewhat larger at age-3
* Current assessment is consistent with recent historical assessments
* Analyses of past performance gives confidence in projections
