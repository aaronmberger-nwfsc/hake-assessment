# Summary

## Summary

* Absolute scale changes for some sensitivities, mostly due to differing
  *R*~0~ estimates.
* Data sensitivities often have changes in the trajectory in recent years.
* Overall pattern is consistent -- large increases in biomass in early
  2010s and current increase in biomass due to 2020 and 2021 recruitment.
* Retrospective squid plots show that since `r assess_yr - 11`, and
  based on medians of the recruitment deviations:
  - the 2021 cohort is being estimated to be approximately as large as the 2014 cohort,
  - the 2020 cohort continues to be estimated high, but less than 2014, 2016, and 2021, and
  - the 2022 cohort is estimated to be slightly less than average.
* Current assessment is generally consistent with recent historical assessments but the 
  relative spawning biomass is less than the 2024 assessment.
