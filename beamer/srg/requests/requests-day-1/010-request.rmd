# Requests

## Request 1 -- "Retrospectives for no age-1 model"

Conduct a 5-year retrospective for the sensitivity removing the age-1 index
â€“ particularly interested 2022 and 2020 year classes.

* Squid plot shows that the 2020 cohort has increased uncertainty at age 3
and the 2022 cohort is estimated to be smaller than the base model predicts

## Retrospectives of model without age-1 index included
```{r retro-last-yr-no-age1, fig.height = 3, out.height = "85%"}

y_lim_squid <- c(-4.5, 4.5)
plot_squid(sens_models[[2]][[2]],
           show_ci = TRUE,
           ci_yrs = c(2020, 2022),
           x_lim = c(0, 12),
           y_lim = y_lim_squid,
           color_offset = 6)
```

## Retrospectives of Base model for comparison

```{r main-retrospective-recruitment-fig, fig.cap = "(ref:main-retrospective-recruitment-cap)", fig.height = 3, out.height = "85%"}

plot_squid(base_model,
           show_ci = TRUE,
           y_lim = y_lim_squid,
           ci_yrs = c(2020, 2022))
```
