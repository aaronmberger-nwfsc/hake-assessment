## Request 4 -- "Spatial distribution"

As feasible, tomorrow or later in the week, show data on the spatial distribution of the stock over time (with a focus on the last two years), especially the proportion of the stock south of the main waters of the US fishery (e.g. 42 degrees N or what is available). For example from catch rates (CPUE), catches, fraction of groundfish trawl survey, eDNA from the hydroacoustic survey, and the hydroacoustic survey.
