# Summary

## Summary of management outcomes

* Uncertainty is large, but stock currently has a `r probs_curr_below_b40`%
  chance of being below `r b_40` and a `r probs_curr_rel_fish_intens_above_1`%
  chance of relative fishing intensity being above 100% (slide 8)

* Based on the default harvest rule, the estimated median catch limit
  for `r min(forecast_yrs)` is `r ct_limit_quantiles["median"]` t
  (with 95% interval from `r ct_limit_quantiles["lower"]` to
  `r ct_limit_quantiles["upper"]` t (slide 11)

* There is `r prob_decl_yr1_zero_catch`% chance that spawning biomass will
  decline from `r forecast_yrs[1]` to `r forecast_yrs[2]` with zero catch
  and 100% chance of decline for all other catch streams (slide 17)

* There is `r prob_decl_yr2_zero_catch`% chance that spawning biomass will
  decline from `r forecast_yrs[2]` to `r forecast_yrs[3]` with zero catch
  and 100% chance of decline for all other catch streams (slide 19)

* Projections strongly influenced by size of the above-average 2021 cohort,
  which is still highly uncertain at this point

## Uncertainty around 2021 cohort is large
