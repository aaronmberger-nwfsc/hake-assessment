# Overview

## Overview of stock assessment (1/2)
* Update Stock Synthesis software
* Update fishery catch and age composition data:
  - Years prior to `r last_assess_yr`
  - Add new data for `r last_assess_yr`
* Update survey biomass estimate and age data:
  - Years prior to `r last_assess_yr`
  - Add new data for `r last_assess_yr`
* Update and add new `r last_assess_yr` weight-at-age data
* Add the age-1 index time series
* All model runs in the assessment use MCMC (including bridging models)

## Overview of stock assessment (2/2)

* The median estimate of `r end_yr` relative spawning biomass is
  `r curr_depl_median`% (with 95% interval from `r curr_depl_lower`%
   to `r curr_depl_upper`%)
* The 2010, 2014, 2016, and 2017 cohorts make up a large fraction of catches
  - 2017 cohort estimated to be average
  - 2018 and 2019 cohort estimated to be below average
  - 2020 cohort estimated to be above average
* Default harvest rule estimated median catch limit for `r min(forecast_yrs)`
  is `r ct_limit_quantiles["median"]` t (with 95% interval from
  `r ct_limit_quantiles["lower"]` to `r ct_limit_quantiles["upper"]` t)
* New `r last_data_yr` age data from fishery and survey are fit well by the
  model
* Coastwide catch in `r end_yr-1` was `r last_yr_landings` t, out of a TAC
  (adjusted for carryovers) of `r last_yr_tac` t
* Attainment in the U.S. was `r last_yr_us_attained`% of its quota
  (`r paste0(ifelse(last_2yr_us_attained_diff < 0, "down", "up"))`
  `r abs(as.numeric(last_2yr_us_attained_diff))`% from last year); in
  Canada it was `r last_yr_can_attained`%
  (`r paste0(ifelse(last_2yr_can_attained_diff < 0, "down", "up"))`
  `r abs(as.numeric(last_2yr_can_attained_diff))`% from last year)
