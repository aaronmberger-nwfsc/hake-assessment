# Summary

## Summary (1/2)

* Based on the default harvest rule, the estimated median catch limit for
  `r min(forecast_yrs)` is `r ct_limit_quantiles["median"]`~t (with 95%
   interval from `r ct_limit_quantiles["lower"]` to
   `r ct_limit_quantiles["upper"]`~t).

* Projections strongly influenced by size of above-average 2020 and 2021
  cohorts, with 2021 being very large but also *highly* uncertain.

* Spawning biomass has a 50% chance of decreasing from `r assess_yr` to
  `r assess_yr + 1` for a 1-year catch of 350,000~t. At that level and higher,
  catch outpaces growth of the 2020 and 2021 cohorts, while continued
  mortality occurs on the older cohorts, driving them to make up a low
  proportion of the stock.

* The decline is even more likely after two and three years of catch.

* Maintaining a constant catch of 625,000~t (the 2023 TAC) gives a 4%
  chance of falling below `r b_40` in 1 year, 11% in 2 years, and
  21% in 3 years.

## Summary (2/2)

* Catch has increased to the B~0~ level in 2 years after a period of 5
  years of decline (2017--2021).

* High proportion of young fish (ages 2--4) predicted in 2024 fishery
  (68% by numbers, 59% by weight).

* Low proportion of fish older than 4 predicted in 2024 fishery
  (32% by numbers, 41% by weight).

* The 2021 year class currently estimated to be very large.

* Uncertainty is large, but stock currently has only `r probs_curr_below_b40`%
  chance of being below `r b_40` and `r probs_curr_rel_fish_intens_above_1`%
  chance of relative fishing intensity being above 100%.

* The model estimates a `r joint_percent_prob_above_below`% joint
  probability of being both above the target relative fishing intensity in
  `r end_yr - 1` and below the `r b_40` relative spawning biomass level at the
  start of `r end_yr`.
