# Summary

## Key metrics

* Uncertainty is large, but stock currently has `r probs_curr_below_b40`%
  chance of being below `r b_40` and `r probs_curr_rel_fish_intens_above_1`%
  chance of relative fishing intensity being above 100%.
* Based on the default harvest rule, the estimated median catch limit for
  `r min(forecast_yrs)` is `r ct_limit_quantiles["median"]`~t (with 95%
   interval from `r ct_limit_quantiles["lower"]` to
   `r ct_limit_quantiles["upper"]`~t).
* Projections strongly influenced by size of above-average 2014 and 2016
  cohorts, 2017 still looks to be average, 2018 and 2019 small, and
  2020 large (but still highly uncertain).
* Spawning biomass will likely increase from `r assess_yr` to
  `r assess_yr + 1` for any catch $\leq 473,880$~t. Driven by expected
   growth of the large 2020 cohort.
* But then likely decline from >50% chance that spawning biomass will
  decline from `r assess_yr + 1` to `r assess_yr + 2` for any catch evaluated
  >0~t.
* Maintaining a constant catch of 473,880~t (the 2021 TAC) gives a 11%
  chance of falling below `r b_40` in 1 year (21% in 2 years' time).
* Overall, we estimate probabilities of future events, and analyses of past
  projections give some idea of the confidence we can have in those
  probabilities.

## Key points
* Catch has continually declined over last five years from a time series
  high in 2017
* Low proportion of young fish (ages 1--3) in 2021 fishery
* Above average 2014 and 2016 cohort biomass: mortality outpacing growth
  (36% and 34% decline, respectively, from beginning of 2021)
* Median female spawning biomass relatively high (65% of `r b_0`), but
  steady recent year-upon-year declines:
  - *B*~2019~ to *B*~2020~: -9%
  - *B*~2020~ to *B*~2021~: -12%
  - *B*~2021~ to *B*~2022~: -13%
* The 2020 year class currently estimated to be above average
* The model estimates a `r joint_percent_prob_above_below`% joint
  probability of being both above the target relative fishing intensity in
  `r end_yr - 1` and below the `r b_40` relative spawning biomass level at the
  start of `r end_yr`
