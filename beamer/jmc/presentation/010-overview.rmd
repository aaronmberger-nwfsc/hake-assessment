# Overview

## Overview of stock assessment (1/2)
* Update Stock Synthesis software
* Update fishery catch and age-composition data in 2 stages:
  - Small updates to years prior to `r last_assess_yr`
  - Add new data for `r last_assess_yr`
* Update survey biomass estimate and age data in 2 stages:
  - Small updates to years prior to `r last_assess_yr`
  - Add new `r last_assess_yr` survey index point
* Update and add new `r last_assess_yr` weight-at-age data
  - Weight-at-age data now come from a model with age, sex, year, and cohort
    as inputs
* Maturity-at-age data now come from a spatio-temporal model with age,
  day of year, and ocean temperature as inputs
* Update the age-1 index time series
  - Add new `r last_assess_yr` index point
* All models run using MCMC 

## Overview of stock assessment (2/2)

* The median estimate of `r end_yr` relative spawning biomass is
  `r curr_depl_median`% (with 95% interval from `r curr_depl_lower`%
   to `r curr_depl_upper`%)
* The 2020 and 2021 cohorts make up a large fraction of coastwide catches
  - 2014 and 2016 cohorts estimated to be above average
  - 2015, 2018, and 2019 cohorts estimated to be below average
  - 2020 cohort estimated to be slightly above average
  - 2021 cohort potentially large (with high uncertainty)
* Default harvest rule estimated median catch limit for `r min(forecast_yrs)`
  is `r ct_limit_quantiles["median"]` t (with 95% interval from
  `r ct_limit_quantiles["lower"]` to `r ct_limit_quantiles["upper"]` t)
* New `r last_data_yr` age data from fishery and survey are fit well by the
  model
* Coastwide catch in `r end_yr-1` was `r last_yr_landings` t, out of a TAC
  (adjusted for carryovers) of `r last_yr_tac` t
* Attainment in the U.S. was `r last_yr_us_attained`% of its quota
  (`r paste0(ifelse(last_2yr_us_attained_diff < 0, "down", "up"))`
  `r abs(as.numeric(last_2yr_us_attained_diff))`% from last year); in
  Canada it was `r last_yr_can_attained`%
  (`r paste0(ifelse(last_2yr_can_attained_diff < 0, "down", "up"))`
  `r abs(as.numeric(last_2yr_can_attained_diff))`% from last year)
