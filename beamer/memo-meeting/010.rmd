# General JTC Updates

## General JTC updates

- Personnel (Kelli, Chantel, 5th JTC member option?)
- Other stuff?

# Research vision, planning, and iteration

- Discuss SRG prioritized list and how the JTC generally approaches that list

- Today will discuss plans for this year and the near-term (1-2 years out), noting that the plan iterates and can change during/after each annual SRG meeting

- The JTC members have other responsibilities and assessments throughout the year, and have limited resources (staff, time) to work on the requests.
