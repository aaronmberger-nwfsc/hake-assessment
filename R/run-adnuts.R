#' Run the adnuts MCMC for the model found in the directory given
#'
#' @details
#' `path` is the directory in which the MLE will be run, a subdirectory of this called `mcmc` is
#' where the MCMC will be run using the NUTS algorithm. Inside the `mcmc` directory, several
#' temporary subdirectories will be created, one for each MCMC chain labeled `chain_*`, AkA
#' CPU number used in the parallel execution. These will disappear once the run has completed and
#' the output has been merged.
#'
#' @param path Directory where the model files reside
#' @param n_cores The number of cores to use in parallel MCMC
#' @param seed The random seed
#' @param n_final The number of final samples
#' @param warmup_final The warmup samples (equivalent of burnin)
#' @param adapt_delta The target acceptance rate. See [adnuts::sample_nuts()]
#' @param run_mle Run the MLE before running the MCMC
#' @param check_issues Run [adnuts::launch_shinyadmb()] after initial short run to discover issues. This will
#' stop the function before the main iterations are done, so you will have to re-run the function again
#' with this set to `FALSE`.
#' @param save_image Save the output as an RData file
#' @param extra_mcmc If `TRUE`, run SS extra mcmc option which outputs files into the `sso` subdirectory. If
#'`FALSE`, those files will not be created and the `posteriors.sso` and `dervied_posteriors.sso` files
#' will be in the running directory
#' @param exe The name of the executable
#' @param input_files The input files for SS
#'
#' @return Nothing
