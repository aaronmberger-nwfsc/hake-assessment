  model,
  probs = c(0.025, 0.5, 0.975),

\arguments{
\item{model}{A model list as created by \code{\link[=create_rds_file]{create_rds_file()}}}

\item{probs}{A vector of 3 values, the lower CI, median, and upper CI}

\item{progress_n}{Report every time this many files are processed. Consider
how many posteriors there are, this should be a fairly large proportion of
that (around 1/8th) or there will be too much output and it will run really
slow}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, show progress messages}

\item{first}{Load this many of the files. If \code{NULL}, load them all. Used
for debugging purposes to cut down the size of the lists used}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to \code{\link[=extract_rep_table]{extract_rep_table()}}}
}
\value{
The extra MCMC list
